		<description><![CDATA[Some things that seem noteworthy and innovative:

1) Boomerang and Gen Y people used to social software are taking it inside the enterprise, for example, what Avenue A/Razorfish has done with its Intranet, public social bookmarking and taxonomies--see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/now_thats_what_im_talking_about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/now_thats_what_im_talking_about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/now_thats_what_im_talking_about/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
2) Suites that combine and deliver a lot of social software functionality in powerful ways, such as Blogtronix
3) Widgetization as Niall Kennedy and Charlie Wood describe it, and what its implications are for content providers
4) Dabble DB, Itensil, and Smartsuite--each is innovative in its own way
5) Amazon&#039;s EC2 as an enabler for SaaS startups to scale up easily and minimize headcount
6) RoR and other frameworks and their implications for accelerating Web app development
7) Established, successful Web app companies with big footprints will do more with less--the best ones, like Digg, start small, stay small headcount-wise and are able to do so with the use of tools like those in #5 and 6 above
8) Having customers develop for you in mission critical enterprise applications--Plexus Systems
9) Alternatives to silicon solar cells for terrestrial applications--Emcore and Spectrolab are using multi-junction GaAs semiconductor compounds and concentrators to achieve 40 percent plus efficiencies, while United Solar Ovonic is succeeding with CdTe thin film solar tiles at much humbler efficiencies
10) Search engines like Twerq that use RSS and folksonomies in conjunction with the Google API to focus search and retrieval efforts

Let me know if this kind of thing is helpful or not, and if it is, I can try to add more.]]></description>
