		<description><![CDATA[Fazal, I agree with you that US broadband policy today lags most of the rest of the industrialized world in catalyzing investment and deployment.

That&#039;s not the issue here.  France and Japan and other countries aren&#039;t succeeding because they prohibit their dominant telcos from using packet prioritization schemes.  They don&#039;t.  They have better broadband because they got local loop unbundling right.  We screwed it up.

And guess what?  That&#039;s an interconnection decision, not a non-discrimination one.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not really a conspiracy theory. Google has demonstrated in China that their real motto is &quot;Don&#039;t be evil, unless it&#039;s inconvenient not to be&quot;. They&#039;d be happy to sell the small people down the river.


You have a very US-centric view of things. Network neutrality is only an issue in the US, mostly because every other place on Earth has government breaking up monopolies and fostering competition, even in formerly dirigiste France. Of course, our venal members of Congress are easily bought by the Telcos and Cablecos (some of the largest campaign contributors around) to turn a blind eye to anticompetitive practices.


Imagine the AT&amp;T-Comcast-Verizon hydra gets its way and the unfettered freedom to discriminate against disruptive services not offered by themselves, or other big business acolytes like Google. Will that kill the Internet? Hardly, just the American part of it. If you think we are lagging badly behind in broadband today...


The end result of the end of network neutrality is not the end of the Internet, but rather America permanently consigned to also-ran status in the information age, and American citizens ultimately as deprived of freedom as Chinese under the yoke of the Great Firewall of China are today.


Of course, network neutrality legislation is an imperfect substitute for real competition, but it&#039;s better than the alternative, which is to do nothing.]]></description>
