		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments, Maura. I don&#039;t know anything about training and development, but one takeaway from my MOOC teaching experience is that there&#039;s too sharp a line between that world and university-based higher education.  

That being said, I agree that if there is a clear instrumental goal for a course, it&#039;s relatively easy to define success criteria.  And indeed, most students took my MOOC as a training course for gamification development. Or at least, I think they did, because they were businesspeople rather than in school.  

In teaching at the university, however, I don&#039;t see my goal as training.  Even when I&#039;m teaching the exact same subject, most students aren&#039;t taking as a prerequisite for a job in the gamification field.   Whenever I ask myself questions like, &quot;what kinds of behaviors/skills do I want my students to leave my class with,&quot; I&#039;m stumped.  I literally stare at a blank screen for a while and then give up.  That&#039;s the hurdle I&#039;m trying to overcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello from Japan!
The topic of this post actually is something that comes up often in the Training and Development field.  Have you looked at the Kirkpatrick Model? (http://www.kirkpatrickpartners.com/)  It raises the question in my mind of what kinds of behaviors/skills do you want your students to leave your class with?  What do you want them to be able to do on the job?  A Wharton MBA is quite an investment.  What&#039;s the return on investment?   It&#039;s been an interesting shift for me as I&#039;ve transitioned from teaching younger learners skills that are largely easily testable to working in a corporate training and development context.

Frankly, as an adult, in a flipped classroom, what I want is more facilitation of learning rather than traditional teaching.  As a trainer, that&#039;s what I provide.  My trainees are capable adults, I&#039;m the subject matter expert on English and business communications.  

On a different, but related note, taking your Gamification class last spring allowed me to partner with my husband Brian, who also took the class, and create a gamified element of our corporate EFL class focusing on increasing the amount of time trainees spend using English outside of class by doing a combination of self-study and more fun quests.   We&#039;re also co-presenting on the topic at the two largest regional conferences next month in Japan and Korea.

So if we go back to the Kirkpatrick Model:
Level 1 - I enjoyed the class.
Level 2- I got a 95% in the class, so I learned something.
Level 3- I brought it back and actually implemented a gamified system on the job.
Level 4 - Well, this one&#039;s really hard to measure, as all our evidence is anecdotal - but the trainees seem to be doing more homework (no control group, and self-reporting on course feedback forms is highly unreliable).  It may also lead to higher course satisfaction.  But that&#039;s yet to be seen.  

Personally, this has been a fun project, and I know I&#039;d love to have a chance to implement other gamification projects professionally in the future as well.  Hmm... anyone stateside want to hire me?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin!

Great post. I think the course might serve two purposes: 1. expose people to gamification. 2. Train people in how to gamify. My majority of people taking the course might not want as a career gamification design but want a general notion of it, so that they can identify circumstances where it is useful and hire a gamification design expert to do it. To evaluate them, your current quizzes and exam might be sufficient. For the people taking the course to become gamification design experts, the assignments seem great. You might want to ask gamification firms how they train their designers and compare/incorporate that. Also, taking a random sample of participants&#039; assignments and comparing their answers to those given by design experts might tell you how much they&#039;ve learned and how much it will transfer when they go work at gamification firms.

There&#039;s also the others things to look at that could improve interest, retention, etc.

There are two Coursera courses that might interest you: 
https://www.coursera.org/course/virtualinstruction

https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata-edu

Yours is a wonderful course! Good luck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I do like the first task for them is to put in a video (1 minute and a half) what they expect to learn in the course and why. They upload the video in a private channel between the first and the second class. Then I check them and I work to develop that skills in the course. After that, I made a control if they feel they get what they want and also a project they develop in all the course to see if they can do what they need. 
I can do that because normally I don´t have more that 30 students and some are group tasks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a technical writer who&#039;s writes for Microsoft Press and also create online courses for a leading company in the field. When you teach outside an established body of knowledge, the only way to measure success is student performance post-class. In other words, how they do in the real world applying what you taught them. Unfortunately, that means you have to wait for the feedback loop to start. I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned about not knowing right away, but stay in touch with your gamified grads to see how your contributions helped them and what you might change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin 
For me the KPIs that I use are: 
1. Students improvement and advance at the educational goals I propose. 
2. The interest of students in the class and activities.
3. My interest. I realize when I have moments I loose interest in teaching to one group is because I´m not getting what I want the students acomplish (sounds a little silly but It´s real)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s actually the subject of my next post, which I&#039;m working on.  But the short version is a combination of &quot;no clue&quot; and &quot;a bunch of different reasons.&quot;  When I ask students why they took the course, the modal response is &quot;the subject sounded interesting.&quot; I&#039;ve yet to get a good answer that way.

The good news and bad news for me is that we don&#039;t have a curriculum, per se. I have pretty much total freedom to do whatever I want in the classes I teach. Some are required and some are electives, but in both cases there&#039;s no directive on what that course is supposed to cover or achieve.  That&#039;s the challenge: it&#039;s entirely up to me to decide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your last sentence caught my eye &quot;I&#039;ve circled back to asking what my goal really is&quot;. Perhaps the question should be &quot;what is the goal of a student taking the course&quot;. Why do they need your course? Is it part of the curriculum for a particular degree? Will it provide them with the skills to pursue future jobs, careers, interests? Perhaps starting the class with the question &quot;what do you hope to get out of the class?&quot;, or &quot;why did you enroll in this course?&quot; could help focus the content a little more. Give the students some say in their education.

However, if it is a mandated part of a curriculum path then perhaps the curriculum needs to be re-evaluated. Universities are very slow to change, more so than K-12 schools, and the curriculum may be out of date. Obviously take this with a grain of salt as I have no idea what a business degree comprises!]]></description>
