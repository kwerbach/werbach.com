				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walk through any public area and you’ll see people glued to their phones, playing mobile games like Game of War and Candy Crush Saga. They aren’t alone. <a href="http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf">59% of Americans play video games</a>, and contrary to stereotypes, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/10/17/more-women-play-video-games-than-boys-and-other-surprising-facts-lost-in-the-mess-of-gamergate/">48% of gamers are women</a>. The <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2614915">US$100 billion video game industry</a> is among the least-appreciated business phenomena in the world today.</p>
<p>But this isn’t an article about video games. It’s about where innovative organizations are applying the techniques that make those games so powerfully engaging: everywhere else.</p>
<p>Gamification is the perhaps-unfortunate name for the growing practice of applying structural elements, design patterns, and psychological insights from game design to business, education, health, marketing, crowdsourcing and other fields. Over the past four years, gamification has gone through a cycle of (over-)hype and (overblown) disappointment common for technological trends. Yet if you look carefully, you’ll see it everywhere.</p>
<h2>Tapping into pieces of games</h2>
<p>Gamification involves two primary mechanisms. The first is to take design structures from games, such as levels, achievements, points, and leaderboards — in my book, <a href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/book/for-the-win/">For the Win</a>, my co-author and I label them “game elements” — and incorporate them into activities. The second, more subtle but ultimately more effective, is to mine the rich vein of design techniques that game designers have developed over many years. Good games pull you in and carry you through a journey that remains engaging, using an evolving balance of challenges and a stream of well crafted, actionable feedback.</p>

<p>Many enterprises now use tools built on top of Salesforce.com’s customer relationship management platform to motivate employees through competitions, points and leaderboards. Online learning platforms such as Khan Academy commonly challenge students to “level up” by sprinkling game elements throughout the process. Even games are now gamified: Microsoft’s Xbox One and Sony’s PS4 consoles offer a meta-layer of achievements and trophies to promote greater game-play.</p>
<p>The differences between a gamified system that incorporates good design principles and one that doesn’t aren’t always obvious on the surface. They show up in the results.</p>
<figure class="align-center zoomable"><a href="https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/75092/area14mp/image-20150317-22297-1hx887r.jpg"><img src="https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/75092/width668/image-20150317-22297-1hx887r.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />

<p>Duolingo is an online language-learning app. It’s pervasively and thoughtfully gamified: points, levels, achievements, bonuses for “streaks,” visual progression indicators, even a virtual currency with various ways to spend it. The well integrated gamification is a major differentiator for Duolingo, which happens to be the most successful tool of its kind. With over <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jordanshapiro/2015/01/08/duolingo-for-schools-may-change-the-edtech-market/">60 million registered users</a>, it teaches languages to more people than the entire US public school system.</p>
<p>Most of the initial high-profile cases of gamification were for marketing: for example, USA Network ramped up its engagement numbers with <a href="http://clubpsych.usanetwork.com/">web-based gamified challenges</a> for fans of its shows, and Samsung gave points and badges for <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/223039">learning about its products</a>.</p>

<p>Soon it became clear that other applications were equally promising. Today, organizations are using gamification to <a href="http://objectivelogistics.com">enhance employee performance</a>, promote <a href="http://keas.com/">health and wellness activities</a>, improve retention in <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/01/how-deloitte-made-learning-a-g/">online learning</a>, <a href="http://www.campaignpage.ca/sickkidsapp/">help kids with cancer</a> endure their treatment regimen, and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">teach people how to code</a>, to name just a few examples. Gamification has potential anywhere that motivation is an important element of success.</p>
<h2>Gamification harnesses innate drives</h2>
<figure class="align-right zoomable"><a href="https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/75217/area14mp/image-20150318-2487-labijn.jpg"><img src="https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/75217/width237/image-20150318-2487-labijn.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Video-Learning-Literacy-Second-Edition/dp/1403984530">Gamification works</a> because our responses to games are deeply hard-wired into our psychology. Game design techniques can activate our innate desires to recognize patterns, solve puzzles, master challenges, collaborate with others, and be in the drivers’ seat when experiencing the world around us. They can also create a safe space for experimentation and learning. After all, why not try something new when you know that even if you fail, you’ll get another life?</p>
<p>The surface dimension of gamification is motivation through rewards: Earn some points, top the leaderboard, get a badge, win a prize and repeat. Behaviorists such as the legendary B F Skinner called this operant conditioning, and it does work … to a point. If there’s really no point to the points, users lose interest. That’s apparently what happened to marketing-driven Samsung Nation, one of the most prominent early gamification examples. Today it’s nowhere to be found on the Samsung website.</p>
<p>Shallow gamification can even be harmful, if it’s used to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6366/persuasive_games_exploitationware.php">manipulate people toward results</a> that aren’t truly in their interest, or if it <a href="http://scottnicholson.com/pubs/meaningfulframework.pdf">suggests</a> that rewards are the only reason to do otherwise intrinsically engaging activities.</p>
<p>The systems that avoid these pitfalls take games seriously. In a good game, the points and the leaderboards aren’t what really matter; the true reward is the journey. Gamification systems that emphasize progression, provide well designed informational feedback, and look for ways to surprise and delight their players can remain engaging for the long haul.</p>

<p>It’s still early in the development of gamification as a business practice. In the next stage, expect gamification features to be incorporated more consistently into software and content platforms, the way social media capabilities are today. And look for systems to take advantage of the wealth of behavioral data from user interactions to refine their effectiveness, as online games have done for years. The next person you see glued to their phone or their computer screen just might be learning or doing their job.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m returning from a packed <a href="http://www.progressivepolicy.org/event/should-the-fcc-serve-as-internet-traffic-cop/">event</a>, hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, on the FCC’s role in Internet interconnection.  It was a good discussion.  And I&#8217;m glad to see these issues getting the attention they deserve.  I was the only panelist calling for an ongoing FCC role as a backstop for interconnection agreements, which I’ve advocated in my <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=964991">Only Connect</a> (2007) and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241658">No Dialtone</a> (2014) papers.  The others were more concerned about the dangers of regulation than the threats from anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>It was an interesting reversal from the conversations I’ve been involved in the past month about network neutrality.  I seem to be one of the few experts who likes FCC Chairman Wheeler&#8217;s proposed approach of using authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to protect the open Internet.  Most of those who, like me, believe that’s an important goal see the only solution as reclassifying broadband access as a regulated &#8220;telecommunications service.&#8221; The FCC is, appropriately, asking questions about both approaches.</p>
<p>One reason I think the 706 route is simpler and more direct is that it’s the only approach to FCC jurisdiction in this area that has actually been validated in court.  It may well be that reclassification could make it through the legal gauntlet, not to mention the political gauntlet, but there’s a fair distance from there to there.</p>
<p>Just before Memorial Day weekend, there was another decision that strengthened the FCC’s hand under Section 706.  In a case involving the FCC’s reform of universal service funding, rural telephone companies and others argued that the FCC had no authority to mandate the availability of broadband.  By retaining its classification of broadband access as an “information service,” they argued, the FCC gave up its ability to utilize the public policy tools that traditionally applied to regulated telecommunications carriers.  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The court independently reached the same conclusion as the District of Columbia Circuit, which decided the <em>Verizon v. FCC</em> case about network neutrality.  Section 706(b), the 10th Circuit found, gives the FCC independent authority to take appropriate steps that it deems necessary to promote broadband deployment.  Calling something an information service doesn’t establish a regulation-free zone. It just puts limits on the FCC’s actions to meet the terms of Section 706, and to allow companies some room for individualized negotiation.  Which strikes me as not inherently a bad thing.</p>
<p>For both Internet interconnection and network neutrality, the challenge is to implement an approach somewhere between the intrusive price regulation traditionally applied to common carriers, on the one hand, and blindness to the dangers of gatekeepers in network industries on the other. I continue to believe that, while there are other routes the FCC could have taken over the past decade, and Congress should by now have fixed a communications law that everyone agrees is broken, our best bet is to accept reality as we find it.  The Section 706 approach isn’t pretty, but it seems to work in court. For anyone familiar with the FCC&#8217;s less-than-sterling judicial record in recent decades, that shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>As Yogi Berra once said, “If you come to a fork in the road, take it.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Wheeler, the new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gave a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/remarks-fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-ohio-state-university">speech</a> today at Ohio State University.  It was a good speech on his regulatory philosophy.  But that&#8217;s not so interesting.  There&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary about a government official giving a speech.  The unusual development was that the Chairman also released an ebook, called <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/page/net-effects-past-present-and-future-impact-our-networks">Net Effects</a>.  Even more unusual, it&#8217;s not a bland ghostwritten policy whitepaper; it&#8217;s a deeply researched work of history.</p>
<p>The speech and ebook focus on something Wheeler calls the &#8220;network compact.&#8221;  He says it&#8217;s essential for the FCC to promote competition.  However, he recognizes there are some problems competition may not solve.  And there are some obligations that arise from the unique social importance of communications networks.  &#8220;Let the market work&#8221; is a great starting point, but if &#8220;the market&#8221; means no one picks up when you dial 911 in an emergency, we&#8217;ve got a problem.  I&#8217;ve made the same argument myself in a paper, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241658">No Dialtone</a>, about the future of the telephone system.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s distinctive about Wheeler&#8217;s perspective is that it&#8217;s rooted in history.  (For those aware of Wheeler&#8217;s two prior books, both about the Civil War, this isn&#8217;t so surprising.)  Wheeler connects the current revolution of connected computing to the prior network revolutions of the printing press, the railroad, and the telegraph.  He draws from this a series of principles.  As important as the principles, though, is the insight Wheeler takes from the very act of doing history. As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It has been suggested that we are living through the greatest network revolution in history. On this the jury is still out. The reverse telescope of history makes prior experiences seem much smaller than they were.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the point of history isn&#8217;t to understand the past; it&#8217;s to appreciate the present.  By looking backwards, we can understand better how we got here, distill lessons from experience, and appreciate how similar situations looked to prior generations. That doesn&#8217;t work when we&#8217;re looking forward, because we have no perspective on the present.  We can project into the future, but we&#8217;re apt to get it wrong by relying on our fresh and localized perceptions of the current state of affairs.  Going back not just to the origins of the telephone and broadcasting, but to earlier networks that in their time were seen as equally revolutionary, helps to wash out the local details and throw the essential concepts into starker relief.  In this regard, Net Effects is the kind of work we should want our leaders to be studying, and doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made no secret that I believe Wheeler will be an outstanding FCC Chairman, based on personal experience with him.  When he was nominated, there was criticism because he spent much of his career leading two trade associations.  It&#8217;s entirely appropriate and ultimately necessary to judge him by his actions in the job, but words matter too.  This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen the leader of a major government agency start his term by publishing an ebook.  I hope it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has anyone on the left suggested that Democrats unite around a set of process reforms for our broken political process? This would be the mirror image of the Republican &#8220;Contract With America&#8221; in 1994, which (A) was fantastically successful, ending 40 years of Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and (B) basically got us into the current mess. At a time when popular support for Congress is at 5%, wouldn&#8217;t you want to be the party of reform?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of things like campaign finance, earmark reform, measures to end gerrymandering, and eliminating the ridiculous Hastert Rule that prevents measures supported by a large majority of the House from ever coming to a vote. Put together a package, and get current officeholders and candidates to sign on publicly. Yes, this would limit Democrats&#8217; ability to do evil things when they control Congress, but that&#8217;s a price worth paying, and Democrats don&#8217;t have the same anti-government bent anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised no one is talking about this possibility. Everyone seems to be focused on substantive issues. It&#8217;s a broken system that allows a small group of extremists to bring the U.S. to the bring of catastrophe, folks. This is exactly what the Framers worried about in the Federalist Papers, and built in processes like checks and balances to avoid. Evidence from California (http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-shutdown-reform-20131019,0,5102606.story) suggests fixing the system actually produces a less partisan, more effective legislature.  Why not give it a shot?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A couple months ago I posted on <a href="http://werblog.com/2013/08/teaching-and-performance/">teaching and performance</a>.  Here&#8217;s another perspective on the same broad topic. I started writing it a while back, but never finished. It answers many of the questions I posed in my other post.  I just don&#8217;t think I found those answers convincing.  </em></p>
<p><strong>Teaching is a form of learning.</strong></p>
<p>When I teach a course, the best way I&#8217;ve found to measure success is asking myself at the end whether I figured out what the course was really about.</p>
<p>Like most beginners, I assumed for years that the essence of a course was its content. As I started to read about pedagogy, I was realized this was dead wrong. The content is the last thing to start with when designing a course.  Pretty much any book you read about teaching in higher education makes this point.</p>
<p>But still something was missing. The first question in backwards course design is, &#8220;what do students need to know?&#8221; This question stopped me completely. I simply couldn&#8217;t answer it. Yes, I was the expert, the one designing the course. And yes, I accepted that courses should be about outputs rather than inputs. Yet somehow, asking what students <em>should </em>learn felt like smashing into a brick wall. I was stuck.</p>
<p>Then I realized why.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t possibly decide ahead of time what students need to know or what the course can teach them.  That&#8217;s something that has to emerge from the alchemy of teaching and learning.  It&#8217;s the part of education that you can&#8217;t get from a textbook, or Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, or perhaps, a MOOC. It&#8217;s the co-creation that occurs between an instructor and students, and more importantly, between students and each other.  A good teacher facilitates a conversation that generates one or more core lessons. A great teacher picks up on what those are, and makes them the focus of learning. None of that exists in the aether before the course begins.</p>
<p>The kind of teaching I&#8217;m describing involves the very real possibility of failure.  This is teaching as high wire act.  There is no guarantee even a master teacher can curate a learning conversation to a point of convergence.  A class whose success cannot be determined by what&#8217;s on the syllabus is a class that may turn out to be a waste of time, at least for some of the participants.</p>
<p><strong>The possibility of failure is a feature, not a bug.</strong>  Failure, as we know, is a key part of learning.  Only when we can fail are we reaching beyond ourselves. (Those who know more than I do about learning theory can insert a reference here to Vygotsky&#8217;s concept of proximal development.)  At the same time, it is only when failure doesn&#8217;t seem scary that we are willing to experiment.  That is one reason games are such exceptional learning tools.  They invite us to try and fail, and fail, and fail, until we eventually succeed. You can always start over with another life or a new session of the game.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m still too afraid of failing as a teacher to open myself up to real learning.  Paradoxically, that makes it more likely that I&#8217;ll fail, or at least find my teaching experiences unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason I found my MOOC teaching in front of tens of thousands of students less scary than interacting in person with a few dozen of them is that we all knew going in that the MOOC was an experiment which could fail, and which the students at least could easily abandon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m participating in the <a href="https://opencourses.desire2learn.com/d2l/home/6669">#WWEOpen13</a> MOOC about open online teaching. For the first unit, we were asked to post our &#8220;teaching philosophy.&#8221;  These kinds of questions typically tie me in knots. They seem inherently circular and unsolvable: to say how I should teach, I need to know what students need to learn, which isn&#8217;t something I can just declare. For whatever reason, this time I was able to tap out ten statements.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d call them a philosophy, but they ring true as commitments I feel comfortable with.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good teaching is good learning… for both the student and the instructor.  Learning means new connections and themes and lessons that weren&#8217;t there at the beginning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I believe in a balance between what the instructor and the students contribute.  Teaching shouldn&#8217;t be a monologue, but it also shouldn&#8217;t be purely a peer conversation: students want the guidance and validation and knowledge that the instructor can orchestrate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Every student should feel they are part of the experience and encouraged to contribute their unique perspectives. In particular, students should not be unfairly disadvantaged by factors such as gender, race, national origin, language, or disability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good courses are well-designed interactive narratives, like good video games.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Attention is the most valuable resource in the world today. My job is to earn my students’ attention.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We live in a digitally connected world of ubiquitous access to information. Teaching that pretends otherwise will fail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment should reward effort. Those who try hard should do well. (Some of those who don’t try hard will also do well, based on sheer ability, but that’s less important.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment is feedback. It should tell both the students and the instructor something about how they are doing, with enough frequency to be useful and motivating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment is learning. It should teach the students something, not just verify what they’ve been taught.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good teaching is fun. Both the students and the instructor should enjoy the experience. Great teaching is great fun.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the MOOC is about online teaching, I don&#8217;t see any reason to make that a point of distinction.  Techniques will vary between a small in-person course, a large in-person lecture, a synchronous online course, and a massive asynchronous MOOC, but one&#8217;s philosophy of teaching shouldn&#8217;t.  And I tend to see see all teaching, at least in higher ed, as a form of blended learning.  We should always use online for a what it does best, and in-person for what it does best.  Our pedagogy should be robust to such variation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Teaching is hard.  </strong>Some people are naturally good at it, and others are naturally quick at developing good teaching skills.  For most of us, though, figuring out how to teach effectively is a real challenge.</p>
<p>As a professor, teaching is a central aspect of what I do for a living.  I&#8217;m deeply committed to teaching well.  And today, social and technological developments are changing the context of teaching and learning in significant ways.  So we have an obligation to rethink what we do in light of the new environment.  Yet I find it hard to talk about teaching with others, at least in the university context that I&#8217;m in.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m trying something new.  I&#8217;ll post some thoughts in the hope of generating a conversation.  <strong>I welcome your thoughts and input.</strong></p>
<p>The starting point for me is that teaching and performance are connected, but distinct. Giving a spellbinding lecture is performance.  It may be good teaching or bad teaching.  It has the advantage (most likely) of getting students to show up, pay attention, and perhaps remember something of the experience for a long time.  All of those are correlated with good teaching.  They aren&#8217;t themselves teaching. Think of a brilliant actor on stage or a great episode of a TV show.  You wouldn&#8217;t call that teaching. It&#8217;s performance.  You might learn something by watching, but the quality of the performance doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate the quality of the learning. (And yes, I know that movies and games and other things can be <em>designed</em> to teach &#8212; I&#8217;m a gamification expert, after all! I&#8217;m talking about the normal ones designed primarily to entertain.)</p>
<p>Performance is an input; teaching is an output.  You can measure performance at the source, but you can only measure teaching at the receiver, which in this case is the student. As a consequence, performance is much easier to see than teaching. Any observer can see it. You can even see it by watching a recording.  It exists, at least in part, outside of the course.  Teaching doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This distinction seems obvious to me, and yet most people I talk to seem to confuse performance and teaching.  And that&#8217;s a problem.  If we reward and encourage performance, we may not actually be encouraging good teaching.  In fact, we may redirect effort away from it, toward things that don&#8217;t necessarily advance learning.  This isn&#8217;t a new problem, or an unfamiliar one.  Basically every text on teaching in higher education published in recent decades criticizes the lecture and the content-delivery emphasis it promotes.  But the emphasis on performance is a particular problem in this age of MOOCs.</p>
<p>MOOCs make performance even more visible, while hiding teaching further.  Now the performances are available to anyone in the world through online video, and directly viewed by tens of thousands of eyeballs in the course.  It&#8217;s easy to compare good performers and bad performers side-by-side.  And the pre-recorded lecture structure (with the dominant xMOOC approach) removes the interactivity that&#8217;s present even in most in-person &#8220;lecture&#8221; courses, as well as the distraction of sitting in a room with other students.  The MOOC experience is just you the student, and the instructor on stage.  And students can vote with their clicks to a greater extent than in a university setting, rewarding the brilliant performers with larger numbers.</p>
<p>None of this is necessarily a bad thing.  In many ways, it&#8217;s a very good thing.  To be clear, I&#8217;m a proponent of MOOCs.  I think they can provide tremendous potential benefits for education, in many contexts. And I&#8217;ve taught a large <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification">MOOC</a>, twice. In many ways that makes it easier for me to see the dangers they also create.  We need to view MOOCs as opportunities for experimentation, not magical solutions.  And among other things, we need to push back on our natural tendency to view their pedagogical effects purely from the standpoint of performance.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my personal problem.  I feel pretty confident that I&#8217;m good at performance.  I do a great deal of public speaking. I get plenty of positive feedback on my ability to convey concepts in an engaging way.  And my Gamification MOOC attracted a high number of students, very strong engagement/completion numbers, and great anecdotal responses.  All well and good.  In fact, those are things I&#8217;m proud of.  Yet they tell me little or nothing about how to teach effectively.  And the support resources I&#8217;ve found for improving teaching are really geared more toward improving performance.  I suspect that most university professors, having gone through PhD programs, are less comfortable with performance than teaching.  I&#8217;m the opposite.</p>
<p>Most of my teaching in my &#8220;day job&#8221; as a professor is in relatively small (20-70) classes, on topics that don&#8217;t emphasize mastery of formal concepts.  The students need to interact, and they need to apply knowledge.  I can&#8217;t get away with just performing.</p>
<p><strong>So here&#8217;s the question I keep coming back to: how do I judge success?</strong>  How can I figure out what&#8217;s good teaching, not just good performance?  Because until I can answer that question, I find it immensely difficult to feel any sense of satisfaction in what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>Good teaching means that students are learning.  But that&#8217;s just rephrasing the question.  How do I know if students are learning?  I can see how it might be possible to answer that question in subjects where there&#8217;s a well-developed, structured set of concepts that students need to master, generations of students have mastered, and instructors have seen students master time and again.  I don&#8217;t teach anything like that.  Any bar I set seems arbitrary: I&#8217;m just making up a target for students to hit.  It doesn&#8217;t tell me if I&#8217;m doing well or poorly as a teacher.</p>
<p>I think if I can develop a better answer to this question, it will make me more effective as both a classroom teacher and a MOOC instructor.  And it will help me understand where I can use the MOOC to enhance my in-person course on the same subject.  This is the benefit and the danger of the &#8220;flipped classroom&#8221; notion: it separates teaching and performance to a large extent.  If the students watch the performance on video at home the night before, what they experience the next day in the classroom had better be teaching.  <strong>That&#8217;s a scary thought.</strong></p>
<p><em>Am I looking at this the right way?  For those of you who teach, how do you decide what constitutes success in a course? What resources were helpful to you in answering that question?  </em></p>
