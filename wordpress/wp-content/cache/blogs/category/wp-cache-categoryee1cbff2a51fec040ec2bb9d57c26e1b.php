<a href="http://www.supernova2005.com">Supernova 2005</a> starts today in San Francisco.  I can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p>To the extent I blog during the next few days, it will be on the <a href=http://supernova2005.silkblogs.com/">Supernova 2005 Weblog</a>.  And we&#8217;ll have lots of other great user-generated content on our <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com/community_connection.htm">Community Connection</a>.  If you&#8217;re not attending Supernova in person, that&#8217;s a great way to follow some of the action happening here at the conference.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Marks, who attended Supernova 2004 from the Netherlands (and will be joining us again <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com">this year</a>), put together a fantastic short video with highlights from last year&#8217;s conference.</p>
<p>The video gives you a bit of the flavor of the event. And the fact that Jonathan put this together on his own gives you the flavor of the kind of people who attend. I like to say, &#8220;There is no audience at Supernova; only participants.&#8221; This is a perfect example.</p>
<p>Check the video out here: (<a href="http://www.supernova2005.com/downloads/supernova1.mov">Quicktime</a> | <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com/downloads/supernova2005.wmv">Windows Media</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pleased to announce that the <a href="http://blog.supernova2005.com/">Supernova 2005 weblog</a> is now up and running.  You can subscribe to the RSS feed <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/supernova2005">here</a>.</p>
<p>The blog is an integral part of <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com">Supernova</a>, which is coming up June 20-22 in San Francisco. Over the next three months, I&#8217;ll split my time posting here and on the conference blog.  As Supernova approaches, we&#8217;ll be adding additional features and participants to this blog, which is powered by our friends at <a href="http://www.silkroadtech.com/index.htm">SilkRoad</a>.  We&#8217;ll also unveil additional online community tools that enhance and extend the physical event.</p>
<p>Frankly, I can&#8217;t imagine doing a conference these days without a blog.  Yet I still see lots of events, even those focused on emerging technologies, that want everything to be a hermetically sealed box around the conference venue.  The success of Supernova, along with other &#8220;extended&#8221; events like <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a>, <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSWi</a>, and <a href="http://www.edventure.com/pcforum/">PC Forum</a>, should be pretty convincing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com">Supernova</a> is really starting to come together.  Registration is now open, so sign up, y&#8217;all!</p>
<p>As usual, we&#8217;ve got some wonderful people speaking.  Here&#8217;s an introduction to a few of them; I&#8217;ll post updates periodically in the future.  The <a href="http://www.supernova2005.com/speakers.htm">speakers page</a> on our Website has a longer list of confirmed participants.<br />
<span id="more-1202"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.att.com/ir/ap/exebios.html#eslambolchi">Hossein Eslambolchi</a> is the chief technology officer of AT&#038;T.  In fact, his full title is CIO and CTO of AT&#038;T, plus president of AT&#038;T Global Networking Technology Services.  And if that&#8217;s not enough, he holds over 100 patents.  Hossein is one of the key architects of the network of the future.  Yes, AT&#038;T has gone through tough times of late, and it has agreed to be acquired by SBC, but it remains one of the world&#8217;s premier communications service providers, with technology and experience second to none.  Don&#8217;t you want to hear what Hossein has to say about convergence and the future of the Net?
<li>I met <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/about/management">Mena Trott</a> at the first Supernova conference, where she helped put together the conference Weblog.  I noticed that my power-blogger friends were switching in droves to the tool that Mena and her husband Ben developed, Movable Type.  At that first Supernova, Mean and Ben sat on the floor in the back of the room at times, but they also made contact with Joi Ito (who would become their lead investor) and Barak Berkowitz (who would become their CEO).  Today, Mena&#8217;s company, Six Apart, is at the crest of the bloging wave.  Mena always has a great perspective on both the new tools that are changing business, social interactions, and media&#8230; as well as on those who use them.
<li><a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/about/masthead.html">Chris Anderson</a> is the editor in chief of <i>Wired</i>.  He&#8217;s done something pretty remarkable in remaking what many wrote off as a vestige of the dotcom era into a publication that is once again vital and an opinion-shaper.  His recent essay, <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail_pr.html">The Long Tail</a>, isn&#8217;t just journalism; it&#8217;s a deeply perceptive analysis of the future of commerce, media, and, well, just about everything.  And, not surprisingly, it ties in perfectly with Supernova&#8217;s themes.
</ul>
<p>As you can see, we have a mixture of different kinds of speakers.  It&#8217;s not just the top executives, or the geeks, or the thought leaders &#8212; it&#8217;s all of the above.  The richness of Supernova comes from the interaction among great people from diverse backgrounds, all with something valuable to say about technology and business.</p>
<p>And, of course, that richness isn&#8217;t limited to those who happen to be speaking this year.  The best part of Supernova is the attendees.  Most of them could be (and often are) on stage.  I hope you&#8217;ll <a href="https://www.supernova2005.com/registration/register.php">join us</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cory Doctorow <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/03/14/lets_reform_sxsws_no.html">takes the organizers and venue of the South By Southwest conference to task</a> for attendee-unfriendly policies on videotaping and electricity outlets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this day and age, it&#8217;s amazing that tech conferences still have<br />
policies like this.&nbsp; It reminds me of the &#8220;no blogging&#8221; rules that<br />
some high-end events still try to enforce.&nbsp; When I organize <a href="http://www.supernova2004.com/">Supernova</a>,<br />
I see myself as an advocate for the attendees.&nbsp; I insist that we<br />
have a working free WiFi connection, as many power outlets as we can<br />
muster, free tools like group blogs and chat rooms for attendees to<br />
communicate, and freedom for participants to report on what&#8217;s happening<br />
at the event.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t imagine this will be anything but the norm<br />
in the future.</p>
