				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FCC announced an <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A1.pdf">order </a> and consent decree fining a small local phone company for <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/archives/2005/02/why_we_need_net.html>blocking </a> the ports used by Vonage&#8217;s VOIP service.  It&#8217;s good to see the FCC taking quick action on Vonage&#8217;s complaint, and fulfilling Chairman Powell&#8217;s commitment to preserve &#8220;Net Neutrality&#8221; for broadband applications.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vonage, the leading independent US VOIP provider, has <a title="Vonage FCC complaint" href="http://www.advancedippipeline.com/shared/article/printablePipelineArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=RBCQRG5Q2SH00QSNDBCCKHSCJUMEKJVN?articleId=60400945">complained to the FCC</a> that a broadband access provider is blocking the ports it uses to provide service.</p>
<p>I and others have been raising concerns for some time that broadband platform owners will use their control of the physical and logical layers of the network to preclude innovation and competition at higher layers.  We&#8217;ve been told this is a fantasy, and that no broadband provider would have an incentive to do so.  Maybe we were right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past two weeks I&#8217;ve been moving into a new office, which is one<br />
explanation for the relatively light blogging.&nbsp; The biggest pain<br />
has been waiting for the DSL line to get hooked up.&nbsp; Trying to do<br />
business with one phone line shared between voice and dial-up Internet<br />
isn&#8217;t a whole lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that Verizon came today to provision the DSL<br />
line.&nbsp; My router arrived from Covad the same morning.&nbsp; The<br />
Verizon tech never even came up to my office, but I saw him drive away<br />
so I figured I&#8217;d try plugging in the router.&nbsp; I ran through the<br />
Covad set-up instructions, and I was online in ten minutes.&nbsp;<br />
Woohoo!</p>
<p>Now comes the good part.&nbsp; I only ordered one regular voice line<br />
because I&#8217;m planning to use VOIP over the DSL connection for most of my<br />
office communications needs.&nbsp; With the broadband link in place, I<br />
can get the virtual VOIP lines set up.</p>
