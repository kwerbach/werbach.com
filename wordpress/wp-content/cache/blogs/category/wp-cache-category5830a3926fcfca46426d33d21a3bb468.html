				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve posted my draft paper, <a title="Higher Standards" href="http://tinyurl.com/d5tekt">Higher Standards: Regulation in the Network Age</a> (Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology, forthcoming 2009) to the SSRN online repository.Â  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As digital networks proliferate, standardized interfaces will define the economic and normative dynamics of markets. In other words, standardization is regulation. Regulatory mechanisms must evolve to emulate the best aspects of the standard-setting process. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should remake itself as a standards organization. Instead of viewing standardization as peripheral to its core mission, the FCC should catalyze adoption of open standards that promote its regulatory objectives.</span></p>
<p>A standards-based approach offers better solutions to the novel issues the FCC now faces, such as network management practices of broadband access providers and unlicensed wireless devices adjacent to broadcast television frequencies. Scholars have begun to appreciate the importance of technical standards in regulating the behavior of communications and information technology firms. However, they have only considered possibilities in which government either subsumes or defers to private standards-setting bodies. This article shows how regulators can see themselves as participants in the standards marketplace. Such an approach will allow the FCC to provide necessary &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; for development of technical solutions to important public policy disputes.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Needless to say, these are my own views and not those of the FCC or the Obama Transition Team, although my perspective is certainly influenced by what I saw during the Transition.Â  I welcome your comments and suggestions.</p>
<p></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Coursey at ZDNet AnchorDesk <a href="http://reviews-zdnet.com.com/AnchorDesk/4520-7296_16-5124348.html?tag=adts">picks up on</a> our IEEE Spectrum article about the coming spectrum explosion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David&#8217;s job is to be cantankerous and pick fights.&nbsp; So I&#8217;m not offended by his comment that &#8220;<span class="m2"><span class="m2"><span class="m2">My<br />
immediate reaction to [the article] is, &#8216;Keep dreaming.'&#8221;&nbsp; He<br />
acknowledges that we make a convincing case; he&#8217;s just skeptical the<br />
spectrum-rich future we paint will arrive quickly or without<br />
tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where exactly we disagree.&nbsp; The IEEE Spectrum article<br />
isn&#8217;t a lyrical vision of infinite bandwidth; it&#8217;s a point-by-point<br />
account of where the new capacity will come from, and why we&#8217;re<br />
confident it&#8217;s coming.&nbsp; Even if you don&#8217;t believe the more exotic<br />
technologies we discuss, such as ultra-wideband, will have any<br />
significant effect, there is still a huge amount of spectrum coming on<br />
the market from simple FCC reallocations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kick from the unlicensed technologies will indeed take some time to<br />
manifest itself fully.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s like dismissing the Web in 1994<br />
or WiFi in 1999.&nbsp; If we know that the wireless world is going to<br />
be transformed, we shouldn&#8217;t dismiss what&#8217;s happening because the<br />
process will take a few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m gratified that most of the comments to Coursey&#8217;s column on the<br />
ZDNet site defend our original article.&nbsp; It doesn&#8217;t help Coursey<br />
that he throws in red herrings like the risk of cancer from cell phones<br />
and the problems with spectrum auctions.&nbsp; Our basic argument, that<br />
more new wireless capacity will soon be made available than over any<br />
comparable period in history, remains unrefuted.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s the title of an <a href="http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/mar04/0304scar.html">article </a>I<br />
co-wrote with Greg Staple, a Washington telecom lawyer, in the new<br />
issue of IEEE Spectrum magazine.&nbsp; We explain how &#8220;open spectrum&#8221;<br />
technologies could, with the right regulatory decisions, massively<br />
increase the usable capacity for wireless communication.&nbsp; More<br />
spectrum is also coming from conventional sources like FCC<br />
reallocation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to overstate how big a deal this could be.&nbsp; Cingular<br />
just spent $41 billion for AT&amp;T Wireless, allegedly because it<br />
desparately needed more spectrum.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re not even imagining<br />
the applications and usage scenarios that will develop when wireless<br />
capacity goes from being expensive and scarce to virtually free like<br />
computer cycles.</p>

about new wireless services is a great example of old telecom<br />
