		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interested what &quot;light-weight innovation&quot; might mean in terms of profit making potential, versus &quot;heavy weight&quot; in terms of traditional strategy thinking on barriers to entry and exit, ease of substitution, access to unique resources, vertical integration, and path dependencies (i.e. I can&#039;t do this job, because I haven&#039;t learned the know how my competitor has, because he competed in the previous generation). Might be an interesting angle on who needs who under future scenarios.
Just A thought.

		<description><![CDATA[When you talk about TV you consider two businesses:

1) The Infrastructure business (Satellite, cable operator)

2) The content business ( TV programs, movies)

When you talk about Internet you must consider a third one:


3) The applications business.

That is by far the revolution of our enterteinment world, it is what allows the customer to make his own content, and it is mostly the content he prefers.
Thus the huge success of the P2P networks, of all the interactive softwares.

But one greater revolution is going to happen soon.

The content that was a monopoly of big corporations, thanks to the lowering cost of the hardware used to make it, will have the competition of millions of &quot;Content makers&quot; and &quot;Content providers&quot;.

The &quot;Infrastructure business&quot; is changing hands.
The customers thanks to the fact that can lease the lines for an afforfdable flat fee, are able to broadcast every content they want.

The &quot;content business&quot; is changing hands too.
From the war between the copyright holders and the &quot;hackers&quot; to the war of &quot;artists&quot; chained to a content producer and &quot;artists&quot; representing themselves.

And it is not difficult to understand who will be the winner.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems that Google is trying to open access to all whereas Yahoo and others are trying to capture prime content and thus develop the fiefdom.  With the suit by the author&#039;s guild going forward, it seems that some would rather fight than accept a bonus check. I like your &quot;combos&quot;.  It is intriguing to speculate on who will marry whom.  Will Google need a cellular  partner or will it count on open cellular browsers?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kevin.

Nice post -- thoughtful as always. Some time we should talk about how the telcos seem to be trying to use Carrier ENUM and related addressing functions to colonize the network protocol layer(s).

Hope all is well.
