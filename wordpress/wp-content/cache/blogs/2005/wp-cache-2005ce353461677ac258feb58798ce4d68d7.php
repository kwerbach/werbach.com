		<description><![CDATA[On Entourage:
- It does show your meeting locations in month/week/day view.
- All-day events display with the same limitation as iCal.
- You can customize the Entourage sounds but only via sound sets that require a bit of &quot;hacking&quot; to customize.
- The week view will give you a fuller view of each day (past 5PM).
- Compatibility with Outlook tends to be a bit better]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin,

I and my family use Now Up to Date, by PowerOn Software.  It comes with a pretty simple &amp; usable server for sharing calendars.

		<description><![CDATA[Gen, I don&#039;t use Mail.app, so that&#039;s not a problem. But in any event, I rarely use my email program to receive calendar items.  If I do, 90% of them come from someone running Outlook.

I do appreciate your help.  I have various kinds of questions and problems that pop up on an unpredictable basis. I keep hearing about the genius bar, but I assume it&#039;s not essentially Mac consultants who work for free for an indefinite period of time -- if so, no one would buy Applecare.  And I have to assume that a question like &quot;how do I switch away from Apple&#039;s iCal?&quot; isn&#039;t the kind of thing they are there to answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin, if you switch to Entourage, you ought to give up mail.app too.  I.e Mail.app and iCal are a pair.

If you want to visualize an all day item in iCal set it not to &quot;all day&quot; but set it to 9am-5pm or whatever, and you&#039;ll see it there, not just at the top.

We, your readers and fellow Mac users, are happy to help, but you might be better served by setting up a time at your local Mac store Genius Bar and go in with a big list of questions for them to answer- this is what they do for a living.  If you want it, you can sign up for their premium service which gives you priority as well.]]></description>
