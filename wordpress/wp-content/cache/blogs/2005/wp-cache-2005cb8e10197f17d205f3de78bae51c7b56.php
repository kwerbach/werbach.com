		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a name I have not heard in some time: Hossein Eslambolchi. I was with Excite@Home when AT&amp;T decided to strongarm it&#039;s way into total control of the company. Then-CEO C. Michael Armstrong sent Eslambolchi to rebuild @Home&#039;s network. I could go on a bitter rant here, but I will simply say that when Eslambolchi left @Home&#039;s campus, AT&amp;T suddenly announced they were building their own network. [Hmmm....] That signaled the demise of E@H. (Read about the history here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/Home+shareholders+cite+ATT+fraud/2100-1033_3-965824.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/Home+shareholders+cite+ATT+fraud/2100-1033_3-965824.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://news.com.com/Home+shareholders+cite+ATT+fraud/2100-1033_3-965824.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2009-1033-845974.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.com.com/2009-1033-845974.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://news.com.com/2009-1033-845974.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ) [Do not misread me here, AT&amp;T was not the only problem facing @Home, but when your #1 stakeholder declines to renew its deal, you can bet you will tank in a hurry.]

I&#039;ll be frank in saying I took saticfaction in seeing them fail in broadband services, including cable and internet, ultimately selling out to ther rival, Comcast. I also take satisfaction in seeing them wither in the face of residential telephony competition - lump the sale [this was sooo not a merger, regardless of what the press articles may say or claim] of the wireless division to Cingular in there as well.

&quot;Change or die&quot; is a more accurate way to state his meaning. AT&amp;T has been passed by on the road the the 21st century by basically everyone. Pull your Dodge Duster of a company to the side of the road so someone with a Hemi-powered Dodge Ram pickup can take you to the bus station. To quote Travis Tritt, &quot;here&#039;s a quarter,&quot; Hossein, &quot;call someone who cares.&quot;]]></description>
