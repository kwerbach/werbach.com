		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments, Maura. I don&#039;t know anything about training and development, but one takeaway from my MOOC teaching experience is that there&#039;s too sharp a line between that world and university-based higher education.  

That being said, I agree that if there is a clear instrumental goal for a course, it&#039;s relatively easy to define success criteria.  And indeed, most students took my MOOC as a training course for gamification development. Or at least, I think they did, because they were businesspeople rather than in school.  

In teaching at the university, however, I don&#039;t see my goal as training.  Even when I&#039;m teaching the exact same subject, most students aren&#039;t taking as a prerequisite for a job in the gamification field.   Whenever I ask myself questions like, &quot;what kinds of behaviors/skills do I want my students to leave my class with,&quot; I&#039;m stumped.  I literally stare at a blank screen for a while and then give up.  That&#039;s the hurdle I&#039;m trying to overcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello from Japan!
The topic of this post actually is something that comes up often in the Training and Development field.  Have you looked at the Kirkpatrick Model? (http://www.kirkpatrickpartners.com/)  It raises the question in my mind of what kinds of behaviors/skills do you want your students to leave your class with?  What do you want them to be able to do on the job?  A Wharton MBA is quite an investment.  What&#039;s the return on investment?   It&#039;s been an interesting shift for me as I&#039;ve transitioned from teaching younger learners skills that are largely easily testable to working in a corporate training and development context.

Frankly, as an adult, in a flipped classroom, what I want is more facilitation of learning rather than traditional teaching.  As a trainer, that&#039;s what I provide.  My trainees are capable adults, I&#039;m the subject matter expert on English and business communications.  

On a different, but related note, taking your Gamification class last spring allowed me to partner with my husband Brian, who also took the class, and create a gamified element of our corporate EFL class focusing on increasing the amount of time trainees spend using English outside of class by doing a combination of self-study and more fun quests.   We&#039;re also co-presenting on the topic at the two largest regional conferences next month in Japan and Korea.

So if we go back to the Kirkpatrick Model:
Level 1 - I enjoyed the class.
Level 2- I got a 95% in the class, so I learned something.
Level 3- I brought it back and actually implemented a gamified system on the job.
Level 4 - Well, this one&#039;s really hard to measure, as all our evidence is anecdotal - but the trainees seem to be doing more homework (no control group, and self-reporting on course feedback forms is highly unreliable).  It may also lead to higher course satisfaction.  But that&#039;s yet to be seen.  

Personally, this has been a fun project, and I know I&#039;d love to have a chance to implement other gamification projects professionally in the future as well.  Hmm... anyone stateside want to hire me?

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Kevin!

Great post. I think the course might serve two purposes: 1. expose people to gamification. 2. Train people in how to gamify. My majority of people taking the course might not want as a career gamification design but want a general notion of it, so that they can identify circumstances where it is useful and hire a gamification design expert to do it. To evaluate them, your current quizzes and exam might be sufficient. For the people taking the course to become gamification design experts, the assignments seem great. You might want to ask gamification firms how they train their designers and compare/incorporate that. Also, taking a random sample of participants&#039; assignments and comparing their answers to those given by design experts might tell you how much they&#039;ve learned and how much it will transfer when they go work at gamification firms.

There&#039;s also the others things to look at that could improve interest, retention, etc.

There are two Coursera courses that might interest you: 
https://www.coursera.org/course/virtualinstruction

https://www.coursera.org/course/bigdata-edu

Yours is a wonderful course! Good luck.]]></description>
