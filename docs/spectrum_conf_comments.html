Policy: Property or Commons</a></h2>March 1, 2003<br>
<i>Transcribed by <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com">Doc Searls</a></i></p>
			<hr>
			<p>I'll start by making the point that
several other people already have &#151; that there are quite a few
areas of agreement between the two camps here &#151; and just try
to quickly set out what I think those are.</p>
			<p>The first one is, we all agree that the
current system is horribly flawed. </p>
			<p>We agree that property and commons are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. <a href="http://rider.wharton.upenn.edu/~faulhabe/">Gerry [Faulhaber]</a>
makes an interesting move,
saying, "that's true, but because a perfect universal property system
can somehow accommodate commons, and a perfect universal common
system everywhere can't accommodate enough property, therefore we
should choose property." </p>
			<p>But I think that's something of a
distortion. We're not here talking about whether any of us finds the
writings of Ayn Rand or Karl Marx more convincing. We're talking
about the real world.  And in the real world, systems are mixed. The
question is whether we need to choose one of them as the overarching answer. </p>
			<p>The third thing I think we agree on, and
it's come up several times, is that there is a great deal of
uncertainty here. We don't know with certainty in a property regime
who is going to participate in an auction, how the auction is going
to go, or what's going to happen. And though we have many speculations
and intuitions and examples on the commons side, we don't know with
certainty how people are going to behave, or certainly how technology
is going to develop in a commons. </p>
			<p>So that should lead us to be humble, to
build room for experimentation and reconfiguration into any system
that we put into place.</p>
			<p>And finally, I think we generally agree
that scarcity and transaction costs are two crucial variables in
trying to make choices between these systems. Those points
are implicit in both the papers [presented here]. The <a href="http://rider.wharton.upenn.edu/~faulhabe/SPECTRUM_MANAGEMENTv51.pdf">Farber/Faulhaber paper</a> talks about scarcity and transaction costs and the
coexistence of the two models more explicitly.</p>
			<p>So where do we disagree? Well, both of the
papers, again Farber and Faulhaber more explicitly, talk about this
idea of property as the overarching default regime, and suggest we
can accommodate commons within it, essentially the way we have public
parks.</p>
<p>That's a nice thing. I really hope it will happen. I think
it might. But I don't think it is good enough to base a choice of
regime on, for a number of reasons. </p>
			<p>First of all, if that makes sense, if a
company, a manufacturer, an Intel or a Microsoft, would find it
valuable to buy up spectrum and make it available as a commons, why
haven't we seen it already? Why hasn't a manufacturer licensed
spectrum under the FCC's flexible use auctions that have been going
on the last few years, and done this? Why in fact have the property
proponents not come up with any real example or analogies for why
this might happen in the real world, as opposed to in the realm of
theory?</p>
			<p>I think the reason is that there is an
incentive problem here. And again this has come up through some of
the discussions, in <a href="http://www.reed.com/dprframeweb/dprframe.asp">David Reed's</a> comments and in particular <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/benklery/">Yochai
[Benkler]'s</a> comments.  But the problem is really a matter of
<i>ex ante</i> vs. real-time decision making. The notion in the
property regime is that you need to, up-front, pay the full value of
the spectrum to the person who is selling it... or what the
person who is selling it will charge, which if there's a holdout
situation may even be more than what its value to them is. In a
property/exclusive rights situation, you can make that
determination. I want to do broadcast television on a
frequency that someone else is using for cellular [phone service],
or on a frequency that is now Channel 57 UHF TV, I can decide what
the value is to me to
offer some other service. But in a commons it's hard to decide ahead
of time.</p>
<p>For example, what's the value of the 2.4 GHz band? I'll give
you a hint. Before Wi-Fi came along, at the FCC we called it the junk
band. It had very little value. Suddenly, in the last three or four
years, which has been largely a period of terrible destruction of
value and lack of investment in telecom, it's exploded. It has become
incredibly valuable; probably much more valuable than it would
have been to someone had they had that band for exclusive use. How
will we know that ahead of time?</p>
			<p> The reason that happened is because there
was an open type of environment. Not a perfect commons, but something
along the lines of a commons, that let people find it and go the
innovator route; let companies deploy technology, do experiments, and
come up with improvements. And we've just seen the beginning of
what's going on in that band so far.</p>
			<p>So the problem with this notion that we
can have public parks, or private parks, or some other kinds of
combinations, is that it assumes too much about the information that
someone would have ahead of time, to get to a policy. And really at a
deeper level this idea of parks is the wrong analogy. Parks compete
with private ownership for land. They don't compete for use. You
don't do the same thing in Central Park as you do in the rest of
Midtown Manhattan. That's the point. But with spectrum we're
competing to offer potentially the same services. And any allocation
to one model or the other, and this is certainly true on both sides,
facilitates for certain uses but it precludes certain business
models, certain market structures. For example, a market that's based
around competition for different kinds of equipment, versus a market
that's based on competition between different exclusive service
providers. Each choice facilitates certain models and each choice
precludes certain models. </p>
			<p>I'll talk about this a little bit more in
a minute in terms of what it means for scarcity and transaction
costs. But think about some other analogies that have that property
where there is contention for the actual use. Not parks vs. real
estate, but public parks vs. private parks &#151; things like campgrounds
and nature preserves. Public highways vs. toll roads. Maybe Linux vs.
Windows. I don't have time to go into all of those. But if you think
about it, the aspect that all of those examples share is that either
the commons regime is the dominant one &#151; we have a lot more
public roads than we have toll roads &#151; or there is no choice
made ahead of time by government. There is room for both systems to
coexist and operate and develop.</p>
			<p>Scarcity. The trouble with the way both of
these papers and many of the property arguments look at scarcity is
that it's done in a very static way. The examples are all about
something like the UHF television situation &#151; a defined
frequency block where spectrum is either not being used, or it's
being used for some sort of low-value activity, and the idea is to
transfer it to someone who can use it for something of more value. Or
maybe we can aggregate and change the boundaries of those blocks a
little bit. But the value of the spectrum &#151; and again this was
mentioned in the initial discussions by David Reed and Yochai Benkler
&#151; the value depends on the technical architecture of the systems
that operate in that spectrum. The availability of the spectrum, how
much there is, how much scarcity there is, is a function of those
architectural decisions.  And the choice of regime influences those
architectures.</p>
			<p>We don't have unlimited bandwidth under
any regime tomorrow in the sense that you can snap your fingers and
suddenly have as much spectrum as you want, at all times, for anything,
for no cost. But we might have unlimited bandwidth in a commons if
you look at it differently.</p>
<p>How long is the U.S. coastline? This is a
famous example from the field of fractals. Well, if you measure the
coastline from a satellite picture, you get one answer. If you
measure it from airplane reconnaissance photos, you'll see a lot more
of the twists and turns in the coastline, you'll get a much bigger
number. If you walk along the coastline with a ruler, and measure
every single twist and turn, and in and out, you'll get a much bigger
number. The coastline is infinite, depending on what scale you look
at it from.</p>
			<p>Now, of course, the coastline <i>isn't</i>
infinite. It's not infinite in any practical sense. But
how big it is depends on how you look at it. How big spectrum is
depends on what kinds of systems are being used in that spectrum. The
advantage of a commons system is that it creates incentives for the
users of that spectrum to use it more efficiently. To design their
existing technologies to be robust for interference that's there, and
to design new kinds of technologies that squeeze more capacity out of
the system. The property regime forecloses some of those alternatives
by putting into place an exclusive use system. The most obvious one
is ultra wideband types of uses, where ultra wideband needs a
<i>wide band</i>, and therefore there is the anticommons problem.
There are a bunch of situations under a property regime where that
kind of technology may not exist. So we get, for example, the easements
alternative that's put forth in the Farber/Faulhaber paper. And again, this
is a good idea: Something that would be worth trying and I hope will
work. But how will we know that easements are going to work?</p>
			<p>First of all, again, property is the
overarching regime. So the burden of proof is all on the easement
user to show that it's not interfering. And how are we going to know
that the easements are wide enough, or robust enough, that someone
can actually build something realistic in the easement? It's sort of
the excess capacity that we throw out there and say &quot;okay
commons, go at it, you have it.&quot; That may actually foreclose any
practical use of the commons. </p>
			<p>Similarly, in terms of transaction costs.
The transaction costs of a property regime increase as the system
gets more dynamic. As you have more degrees of flexibility, [there are] different ways to use the system, different mechanisms where you have people
relaying each other's traffic, or cooperating and sharing &#151; some of
the kinds of technologies that David Reed talked about. And in a
property system, every time you do more flexibility, you need more
transactions. You need to price, you need to decide, you need to have
someone buying and selling. So that transaction cost grows.</p>
			<p>It doesn't scale. And
actually the <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-228552A1.pdf">Kwerel
and Williams paper</a> inadvertently shows some of
these transaction cost difficulties when they go through this laundry
list of aspects that they would want to put into an auction. Things
like combinatorial bidding. But they probably can't be done, just
because the auction software isn't complex and sophisticated enough
to support it today.  And that's just in the initial allocations.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, commons creates this
incentive for real-time decision-making, which was brought up a
little bit before. Think about what happens in the Internet. Many
experts like, for example, Bob Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet,
thought the Internet would collapse. Why does the Internet not
collapse? Because everyone has an incentive not to go to a court, and
not to go to a government when someone is preventing their packet
from getting from A to B. If their packet doesn't get from A to B,
they have an incentive to route around it. The Internet treats these
things as damage and routes around them. If we decentralize the
decision-making process to the participants in the market in real
time, as opposed to assuming that ahead of time they can decide what
the value is and transact. </p>
			<p>So a commons that is failing one day may
be successful tomorrow, as people route around problems. A commons
doesn't just address the issues that we have today. It puts in place
the facility to address the issues of tomorrow. And that's the kind
of regime we should be looking for.</p>
