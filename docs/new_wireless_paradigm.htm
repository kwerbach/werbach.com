<p class=MsoBodyText>Almost everything you think you know about spectrum is wrong.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For nearly a century, radio
  frequency spectrum has been treated as a scarce resource that the government
  must parcel out through exclusive licenses. Spectrum licensing brought us radio,
  television, cellular telephones and vital public safety services. Along the
  way, the licensing model became an unquestioned paradigm, pervading our views.
  We simply can’t imagine doing anything else.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The assumptions underlying
  the dominant paradigm for spectrum management no longer hold. Today’s digital
  technologies are smart enough to distinguish between signals, allowing users
  to share the airwaves without exclusive licensing. Instead of treating spectrum
  as a scarce physical resource, we could make it available to all as a commons,
  an approach known as “open spectrum.” Open spectrum would allow for more efficient
  and creative use of the precious resource of the airwaves. It could enable innovative
  services, reduce prices, foster competition, create new business opportunities,
  and bring our communications policies in line with our democratic ideals. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite its radical implications,
  open spectrum can coexist with traditional exclusive licensing. There are two
  mechanisms to facilitate spectrum sharing: unlicensed parks and underlay. The
  first involves familiar allocated frequency bands, but with no user given the
  exclusive right to transmit. A very limited set of frequencies have already
  been designated for unlicensed consumer devices, such as cordless phones and
  wireless local area networks, but more is needed. The second approach allows
  unlicensed users to coexist in licensed bands, by making their signals invisible
  and non-intrusive to other users. Both open spectrum approaches have great value,
  with the specifics depending on how technology and markets develop. Both should
  be encouraged. The risks are minimal, while the potential benefits are extraordinary.
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If the US Government wants
  to put in place the most pro-innovation, pro-investment, deregulatory, and democratic
  spectrum policy regime, it should do everything possible to promote open spectrum.
  Specifically, Congress and the FCC should take the following four steps:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'>•     Develop rules to foster more effective cooperation among unlicensed users</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'>•     Set aside more spectrum for unlicensed uses</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'>•     Eliminate restrictions on non-intrusive underlay techniques across licensed
  bands</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'> •     Promote experimentation and research in unlicensed wireless technology</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>We can glimpse the possibilities of open spectrum
  in existing unlicensed bands. While most frequencies are licensed exclusively,
  <span class=GramE>a handful are</span> open for anyone to transmit within technical
  parameters such as power limits.<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span> </span></a> The unlicensed bands are limited, congested, and devoid
  of any interference protection. Indeed, the most widely used, at 2.4 GHz, is
  so filled with devices such as microwave ovens, cordless telephones, and baby
  monitors that it is known as the “junk band.” Yet this is the site of the most
  explosive phenomenon in the wireless world: <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>.
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WiFi</span></span>
  (IEEE 802.11) is a protocol for unlicensed wireless local area networks, allowing
  high-speed data connections anywhere within a few hundred feed of an access
  point.  <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> deployments are growing at fantastic
  rates, doubling in the last year.  A market that did not exist three years ago
  now generates well over a billion dollars annually, continuing to expand despite
  a severe technology recession. There are thousands of public access points in
  the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:
  12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>,
  and hundreds of thousands more in homes and businesses. Several million laptops
  are equipped with <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> cards, and most laptop vendors
  are building <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> into their newer models.  Investment
  and innovation run rampant. Venture-backed startups are springing up to improve
  <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> technology and apply it to new markets, such
  as residential broadband access.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
class=SpellE><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>WiFi</span></span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> shows only a fraction

  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
  government took steps to facilitate the full realization of open spectrum, it
  would achieve several vitally important policy goals. Moreover, it would do
  so by moving away from heavy-handed regulation towards a free-market environment
  in which innovation and service quality matter more than government-granted
  privileges.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Open spectrum is neither science fiction
  nor wishful thinking about human nature. Its ideas are rooted in well-established
  engineering techniques and mainstream economics, and its viability has been
  proven in mass-market implementations involving millions of users. It is time
  to question our long-held assumptions, and explore new policy approaches that
  could generate tremendous benefits for the American people.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For all its benefits, open
  spectrum represents a challenge to traditional ways of thinking, which is bound
  to provoke opposition. Incumbents comfortable with the status quo will seek
  to preserve the inflated values of their government-issued licenses. Licensed
  users express concerns that open spectrum techniques will generate interference
  that harms their businesses or important public services. Some economists who
  advocate turning spectrum into private property have been unwilling to see that
  open spectrum is even more market-based than the approach they favor. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>These and other groups argue for actions
  that would hamstring open spectrum. They raise legitimate concerns, but their
  worries are unfounded. Spectrum policy is full of mistaken assumptions that
  have guided decision-making for too long. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Open spectrum explodes the following
  myths:</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><b>1)   Wireless</b><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> spectrum is scarce</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span>      </span>Spectrum appears scarce only because our current regulatory
  regime puts draconian limitations on its use. If multiple users were allowed
  to dynamically share frequency bands, and to employ cooperative techniques to
  improve efficiency, spectrum could be as abundant as the air in the sky or the
  water in the ocean.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><b>2)   Auctions are the best mechanism to put spectrum into the marketplace
  </b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span>      </span>It has become conventional wisdom that auctions are the only
  efficient mechanisms for spectrum assignment, because they leverage market forces.
  Auctions have many benefits, but they force service providers to pay high up-front
  costs and grant what amounts to a monopoly over certain frequencies. <span class=GramE>Allowing
  companies to compete through innovation while sharing the spectrum as a common
  resource is in many cases a superior approach.</span> </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><b>3)   Massive capital investment is needed to exploit the spectrum</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span>      </span>Licensed service providers such as cellular telephone operators
  and television broadcasters must build out expensive distribution networks before
  they can deliver services to customers. Often, they must also pay to obtain
  the spectrum itself in auctions. These huge capital expenditures must be recovered
  through service fees. In an unlicensed environment, by contrast, access to the
  airwaves is free and the most significant expense—the intelligent radios—are
  purchased directly by end-users.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><b>4)   The future of wireless lies in third-generation (3G) systems</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span>      </span>3G represents a useful advance in cellular technology, but
  it is hardly a panacea. Spectrum and build-out costs for 3G will be enormous.
  Many of the wireless data services identified with 3G could be more efficiently
  delivered through short-range and meshed unlicensed technologies, with wide-area
  3G service reserved for situations where those alternatives aren’t available.
</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><b>5)   Wireless technologies are not viable solutions to the last-mile bottleneck</b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;
'><span>      </span>The last mile does pose special challenges for wireless systems.
  However, these challenges may be overcome through unlicensed systems that use
  long-range communications, wideband underlay or meshed architectures. With cable
  and telephone wires into the home controlled by dominant incumbents, and enormous
  capital required to extend fiber to every home, open spectrum represents the
  best hope for a facilities-based broadband alternative.</p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> Defined</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>Most wireless frequency bands are licensed, meaning
  that the government gives an entity such as a radio broadcaster or the military
  the exclusive right to transmit on those frequencies.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"
title=""><span> <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[2]</span>
  </span></a> That license comes with restrictions on geography, power output,
  technical characteristics and/or service offerings. Transmission in the band
  by any other party is prohibited as “harmful interference.” This regime is considered
  necessary because the alternative would be a “tragedy of the commons”: a chaotic
  cacophony in which no one could communicate reliably. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The tragedy of the
  commons idea resonates with our intuitions. After all, too many sheep grazing
  in the same meadow will use up all the grass. Too many cars on a highway at
  the same time will cause traffic jams and collisions. Why should spectrum be
  any different?</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Spectrum <i>is </i>different.
  It is different because it is inherently non-physical, and because technologies
  developed in recent years <span
class=GramE>make</span> it practical to avoid the tragedy of the commons. What
  these technologies have in common is that they allow more than one user to occupy
  the same range of frequencies at the same time, obviating the need for exclusive
  licensing. <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""> <span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[3]</span></span>
  </a></p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'>“Open spectrum” is an umbrella term for such approaches.<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span> </span></a> As used here, open spectrum includes established unlicensed
  wireless technologies such as <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>. It would be a
  mistake, however, to conclude that the existence of <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> proves no further action is needed to facilitate open
  spectrum. <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> was designed for short-range data communication
  and the limitations of current spectrum rules.  It therefore still requires
  wired “backhaul” connections to the public Internet. Moreover, current unlicensed
  bands and technical standards are not optimized for efficient spectrum sharing.
  Enlightened policies will allow the emergence of open spectrum systems that
  are self-contained, and can handle a range of services and environments. A true
  open spectrum environment would allow the same degree of openness, flexibility,
  and scalability for communication that the Internet itself promotes for applications
  and content.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>There are two ways to implement open spectrum technologies.
  The first is to designate specific bands for unlicensed devices, with general
  rules to foster coexistence among users. This is the approach that allowed <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>
  to flourish in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. The second mechanism is to “underlay”
  unlicensed technologies in existing bands, without disturbing licensed uses.
  This approach, epitomized by the ultra-wideband technology the FCC authorized
  earlier this year, effectively manufactures new capacity by increasing spectrum
  efficiency. Underlay can be achieved either by using an extremely weak signal
  or by employing agile radios able to identify and move around competing transmissions.<a href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span> </span></a></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Both unlicensed bands and underlay have
  their place. Eventually, underlay approaches will be more significant, because
  they can work across the entire spectrum rather than requiring the creation
  of designated “parks.” Someday, if underlay is successful enough, we may not
  need licensed bands at all, but that day is well in the future. The important
  point today is to allow both unlicensed bands and underlay to develop based
  on technological capabilities and market demand. That involves four steps: removing
  limitations in existing rules, creating additional unlicensed bands, establishing
  rules to facilitate additional forms of underlay, and funding research into
  next-generation technologies.</span></p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc17533072"><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>By Land or By Sea</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Open spectrum is actually a simple concept.
  It requires no flights of fancy about the laws of physics. It sounds strange
  because, as the examples above suggest, we are accustomed to thinking of the
  radio spectrum as a scarce physical entity, like land. Charts showing the partitioning
  of the spectrum and auctions for geographically defined rights to slices of
  the airwaves reinforce the physicality of spectrum. We can’t see or touch the
  radio spectrum, so we envision it as something solid and familiar. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>This is a mirage. There is no “<span
class=SpellE>aether</span>” over which wireless signals travel; there are only
  the signals themselves, transmitters and receivers. What we call “spectrum”
  is simply a convenient way to describe the electromagnetic carrying capacity
  for the signals. Moreover, the spectrum isn’t nearly as congested as we imagine.
  Run a spectrum analyzer across the range of usable radio frequencies, and the
  vast majority of what you’ll here is silence. Even in bands licensed for popular
  applications such as cellular telephones and broadcast television, most frequencies
  are unused most of the time in any given location.<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span> </span></a> This is the case because historical spectrum allocations
  assume dumb devices that have a hard time distinguishing among signals, thus
  requiring wide bands with large separation.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>With today’s technology, the better metaphor for
  wireless is not land, but oceans.<a href="#_edn7"
name="_ednref7" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span> </span></a> Boats traverse the seas. There is a risk those boats
  will collide with one another. The oceans, however, are huge relative to the
  volume of shipping traffic, and the pilots of each boat will maneuver to avoid
  any impending collision (<i>i.e.</i> ships “look and listen” before setting
  course). To ensure safe navigation, we have general rules defining shipping
  lanes, and a combination of laws and etiquette defining how boats should behave
  relative to one another. A regulatory regime that parceled out the oceans to
  different companies, so as to facilitate safe shipping, would be overkill.<a href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span> </span></a> It would sharply reduce the number of boats that could
  use the seas simultaneously, raising prices in the process. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The same is true with spectrum. Allowing
  users to share spectrum, subject to rules that ensure they do so efficiently,
  would be far more effective than turning more spectrum over to private owners.
  </span></p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc17533073"><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The Crowded Room</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>If the idea that many users can coexist
  in the same spectrum sounds counter-intuitive, another analogy should help.
  Wireless communication in the radio-frequency spectrum is fundamentally similar
  to wireless communication in the acoustic spectrum, otherwise known as speech.
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Imagine a group of people in a room.
  Experience tells us that everyone can carry on a conversation with his or her
  neighbor simultaneously, even with music playing the background, so long as
  people speak at a normal volume. If someone starts yelling, he or she will drown
  out other speakers, who will be forced to speak louder themselves in order to
  be heard. Eventually, some portion of the room simply won’t be able to communicate
  over the background noise, and each additional person who starts yelling will
  reduce the total number of conversations. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>We could call that a “tragedy of the
  commons.” We could enact laws giving only some individuals the right to speak
  during defined times, ensuring they can shout as loud as they want without interference.
  But that would clearly be an unnecessary solution with significant negative
  consequences. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Think back to the situation where everyone
  is speaking in a normal tone of voice. What allows so many conversations to
  occur simultaneously is that the people talking are modulating their communications
  in an appropriate way, and the people listening are able to distinguish one
  conversation from another. It’s the intelligence at the ends of the conversation,
  not the integrity of the <span class=GramE>signal, that</span> allows for more
  efficient communication. The same is true in the radio frequencies. Intelligent
  devices can distinguish among more simultaneous transmissions than simple ones.
  The more sophisticated and agile the system, the more the overall carrying capacity
  of the spectrum increases.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>One might protest that the speaking analogy breaks
  down when people want to communicate across the room. Here too, there is no
  reason many conversations can’t occur simultaneously. By listening carefully,
  people can pick out individual speakers. Moreover, imagine that the people in
  the room could pass messages back and forth on pieces of paper. By cooperating
  to relay the communications, they would significantly increase the number of
  conversations, especially over long distances. Relaying and other cooperative
  techniques can serve the same function in the wireless world.<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span> </span></a></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>As this analogy points out, the term “interference”
  is problematic. Radio waves at the relevant frequencies do not bounce off one
  another. They pass through each other cleanly, like the intersecting ripples
  from two stones thrown into a pond.<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[10]</span> </span></a> The overlapping signals simply make it harder for a
  receiver to distinguish one from another. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>“Interference” is thus highly contingent
  on real-world factors. Again, this shouldn’t be surprising. Put two television
  sets next to one another, and you may get a sharp picture on one but a fuzzy
  image on the other. The difference is that one set has a better tuner. Do we
  register “interference” when it shows up on one set, or both? Should the most
  poorly designed set define the requirements for everyone else? What if there
  is no set in the room but a hypothetical set with certain characteristics <i>might</i>
  experience a degraded picture there? Under current spectrum policy, such hypothetical
  “interference” prevents frequency sharing. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Whatever rules we set will influence
  behavior. If “interference” is defined with reference to a dumb receiver, vendors
  will try to save money and make receivers as dumb as possible. If, on the other
  hand, manufacturers have no guarantee of spectrum exclusivity, they will have
  the opposite incentive. They will build devices robust enough to deal with a
  variety of situations, bounded by the overall technical rules for use of the
  spectrum band. Those building transmitters or delivering services over the spectrum
  will face similar incentives depending on the way the rules are defined. The
  point is not that the most unrestricted environment is always the best. It’s
  that our current system, without justification, assumes an exclusive licensing
  regime is the only viable answer. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>There are three primary techniques for
  magnifying the efficiency of wireless devices in a shared environment: spread
  spectrum, cooperative networking and software-defined radio. These can all be
  used in licensed bands, though they reach their full potential in an unlicensed
  environment.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Spread Spectrum</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>In a spread-spectrum system, wireless communications
  are digitized and chopped up into pieces, which are spread across a range of
  frequencies.<a
href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[11]</span> </span></a> If the receiver knows where to look, it can piece the
  message back together on the other end. Spread spectrum means that an individual
  frequency only carries a small part of each communication, so it’s only occupied
  for a tiny slice of time. In the unlikely event that another message is occupying
  that slot, only that small portion of the signal must be re-sent. Spread spectrum
  was invented in the 1940s, and has been used extensively for military and other
  applications that require robustness and resistance to jamming or eavesdropping
  (because only the receiver knows how the signal is spread across the range of
  frequencies). Many mobile phone services use spread-spectrum today to improve
  efficiency within licensed bands, but the technique is even more powerful when
  used for underlay or in unlicensed bands.</p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Cooperative Networking</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The capacity of a wireless system is influenced
  by its architecture. A broadcast television network allows for many receivers
  but only one transmitter. By contrast, cellular telephone systems use a network
  of cells and towers to allow people to both call and receive calls. We may assume
  that the cellular hub-and-spoke architecture is the best we can do, but it isn’t.
  If the end-user devices cooperate with one another, such as by relaying signals
  of other users, the system can be more efficient.<a href="#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[12]</span> </span></a> With cooperation, adding users increases supply as well
  as demand. One form of cooperative network is the mesh architecture, where every
  transmitter also serves as a relay. A user need only be able to communicate
  with another user, rather than with a central tower, to send a signal anywhere
  on the network. Some cooperative networks can be deployed <i>ad hoc</i>, meaning
  that new nodes can be added anywhere and they will automatically become part
  of the network. </p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Software-Defined Radio</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every radio can be tuned
  to pick up a certain range of frequencies, and it takes some amount of time
  to change the tuning. Traditionally, these characteristics are fixed in the
  radio hardware. Thus, for example, the same radio can’t pick up <span class=GramE>both
  FM radio and mobile phone transmissions, or</span> both 2.4 <span class=SpellE>Ghz</span>
  and 5 <span class=SpellE>Ghz</span> wireless LAN signals. Software-defined radios,
  by contrast, can tune dynamically over a wider range of frequencies. A software-defined
  radio can receive or transmit different kinds of wireless transmissions automatically.
  If it is a so-called “agile radio,” it could adapt to the local environment
  and seek out open frequencies to communicate. Even in licensed bands, most of
  the spectrum is empty most of the time. Agile radios could take advantage of
  that empty space, moving out of the way when another transmission appears. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>All of these areas are the subject of
  extensive academic research and corporate R&amp;D. Nonetheless, the licensed
  spectrum model has been the dominant paradigm for so long that there is a surprising
  amount we simply don’t know about how radios work. For example, we don’t know
  as a theoretical matter what the maximum capacity is of a geographically defined
  system filled with randomly distributed radios. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>We do know that many of our intuitions are wrong.
  Research has shown that many factors we believe should decrease the capacity
  of a system—adding more transmitters, creating more alternative paths for signals
  to travel, or putting receivers in motion, for example—can actually increase
  capacity.<a href="#_edn13"
name="_ednref13" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[13]</span> </span></a> This occurs because the more data a smart receiver has
  about the surrounding environment, the better it can do in distinguishing the
  desired signal. </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The commercial viability of any system
  using these techniques will depend on business conditions. That is one reason
  government policies should advance both designated unlicensed bands and underlay
  approaches that coexist in licensed bands. Under any scenario, though, open
  spectrum is not a fantasy, but a concept based on proven techniques. It is time
  for our policies to catch up with the state of technology.</span></p>

<h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>To take advantage of the fantastic potential
  of open spectrum, we must change our spectrum policies. With a few exceptions,
  existing laws and regulations are rooted in historical anachronisms.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Since the passage of the Federal Radio
  Act in 1927 and the Communication Act in 1934, virtually everything about wireless
  has changed. What began as a technology for ship-to-shore communication became
  the foundation of the radio, broadcast television, satellite and cellular telephone
  industries, as well as supporting private radio services, public safety communications,
  military communications, wireless data networking and a host of other applications.
  The amount of spectrum considered usable has increased dramatically, as more
  sophisticated devices have been developed. Analog services are giving way to
  digital, allowing for additional features and efficiency. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Everything has changed except for one very important
  thing:  We still regulate the radio spectrum based on the technology of the
  1920s.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Spectrum licensing arose in the 1920s
  because of a historical phenomenon. Radio receivers of the period were primitive.
  They couldn’t distinguish well between different transmissions, so the only
  way for multiple users to share the spectrum was to divide it up. In 1912, nearby
  ships hadn’t responded to the <span class=SpellE><i>Titanic</i>’s</span> distress
  calls, prompting calls for regulation. By licensing spectrum to broadcasters,
  with wide separation between bands, the government could ensure that receivers
  could identify which signal was which. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The exclusive licensing model was almost
  certainly the right approach when it was developed. It has been in place for
  so long, during which there has been so much commercial innovation in use of
  the wireless spectrum, that we take it for granted. When you think about it,
  though, our approach to spectrum is the exception rather than the rule. We shrug
  at intense government regulation of communications over the airwaves that would
  be unconstitutional in other media. After all, wireless communication is speech.
  Under the First Amendment, the government faces a high burden in justifying
  any law that defines who may communicate and who may not. Yet Congress and the
  FCC routinely determine who may broadcast on certain frequencies, and they regularly
  shut down those, such as “pirate” radio broadcasters, who fail to observe those
  rules.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>The rationale for limiting speech over the airwaves
  is that there is no alternative. Spectrum is scarce, so the argument goes, so
  either some may speak or none will be able to get their message across amid
  the cacophony of interfering voices.<a
href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[14]</span> </span></a> As discussed above, though, that scarcity is not an
  immutable property of a physical spectrum resource. It’s a historically and
  technologically contingent judgment.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Needless to say, much has changed since the 1920s.
  And indeed, there has been a major shift in the government’s approach to spectrum
  assignment. Auctions have replaced outright grants, competitive hearings, and
  lotteries as the tool of choice. Beginning with Ronald Coase’s seminal 1959
  article, “The Federal Communications Commission,”<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[15]</span> </span></a> economists have argued persuasively that competitive
  bidding is the most efficient way to assign scarce licenses among competing
  users. Starting with the personal communications service (PCS) auctions of 1994,
  the FCC has raised over <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>$30 billion f</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>or the US Treasury and delivered substantial
  new spectrum to the marketplace in this manner.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Most of the debates around spectrum policy today
  involve variations of the auction idea. Some parties advocate secondary markets<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[16]</span> </span></a> or moving from licenses to fee simple ownership,<a
href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[17]</span> </span></a> while others propose combining auctions with annual
  lease fees after the initial license period.<a href="#_edn18"
name="_ednref18" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[18]</span> </span></a> These debates, intense though they may be, occur within
  the safe confines of the dominant exclusive licensing paradigm. If we have decided
  to license wireless frequencies, there are important questions about how best
  to do so. But why take licensing for granted?</p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><a name="_Toc17533077"><span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A Spectrum Commons</span></a><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Capacity-magnifying techniques such as
  spread spectrum, cooperative networking and software-defined radio make it possible
  to see spectrum as something other than a physical resource to be licensed.
  Portions of the radio spectrum could instead be treated as a commons. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>A commons, like the air we breathe and the language
  we speak, is a shared, renewable resource. It is open to all. It is not completely
  free or inexhaustible, but it can seem that way if individuals follow rules
  to prevent over-grazing. A commons is entirely compatible with competitive capitalism.
  The key is that the marketplace occurs among users of the commons; the commons
  itself cannot be bought or sold. We have no trouble accepting the automobile
  and trucking industries, even though they depend on public roads and highways
  that are free to use and maintained by the government.  And we accept that even
  though anyone can drive on the highway, everyone has to observe speed limits,
  seatbelt laws, and other safety rules. Those public roads even coexist with
  private toll roads, but we don’t think that privatizing all the roads would
  improve the quality of transportation in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A spectrum commons works just like the
  highways. Government defines the scope of the common resource and sets limited
  rules to facilitate efficient use. That means setting aside unlicensed frequencies,
  adopting rules to facilitate new “underlay commons,” setting power limits or
  other technical standards, and responding to any breakdowns. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The beauty of a spectrum commons is that
  is creates the right incentives. Exclusive licensing and <span class=SpellE>propertization</span>
  create spectrum monopolies, which seek to maximize the rents they can collect.
  Forcing licensees to buy spectrum at auction ensures it goes to those who value
  it highly, but it forces the winner to recoup its up-front investment, biasing
  the way it makes use of the spectrum. As noted above, exclusive licensing also
  encourages receiver manufacturers to make their devices as dumb as possible,
  while a spectrum commons has the opposite effect. In a commons environment,
  companies can respond to marketplace demands by tailoring new services, since
  the costs of entry are minimal. </span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Arguments about the benefits of open
  spectrum have in the past been largely theoretical. Techniques such as spread-spectrum
  were widely employed, but primarily in licensed bands or in military applications.
  Academic research showed the benefits of a spectrum commons. Without mass-market
  commercial examples, though, few were convinced the idea could fly in the real
  world.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Such real-world validation arrived in the form of
  <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> and related wireless local area network (LAN)
  technologies. <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> is a marketing and certification
  term promulgated by the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, an industry
  trade group. It refers to the 802.11b and 802.11a wireless Ethernet standards
  defined by the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span>
  <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[19]</span> </span></a> 802.11b, which was the first to take off commercially,
  operates in the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and delivers
  data speeds up to 11 megabits per second. 802.11a operates in the 5 GHz U-NII
  band and offers connections up to 54 megabits per second.<a
href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span> <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[20]</span> </span></a> Standards work in this area is ongoing, with proposed
  standards including 802.11g, which delivers higher-speed connections in the
  2.4 GHz band, and 802.11e, which adds quality-of-service mechanisms to support
  high-quality voice and video delivery.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'>The IEEE issued the final 802.11b standard in September
  1999. The first mass-market commercial implementation, Apple’s AirPort technology,
  went on the market that year. Since then, the market has grown rapidly, with
  expected sales of some 10 million PC/laptop adapter cards this year. Vendors
  such as Cisco, <span class=SpellE>Linksys</span>, D-Link, <span

  business selling access points for home networks, adding value to residential

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Though <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>
  was originally developed for corporate LANs, it has garnered attention for two
  applications: hotspots and community access points. Hotspots are wireless access
  points deployed in high-traffic locations such as hotels, airports, and cafes.
  Typically, the facilities owner contracts with a company that installs the necessary
  equipment and Internet connection, with the revenue split between them. Sometimes
  the service provider keeps all the revenue, with the facilities owner benefiting

<p class=MsoHeading8>Campus Networking</p>

  deploying <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> networks across their corporate campuses
  to provide ubiquitous connectivity for their employees; universities are doing
  the same for their students and faculty. Unlike the consumer access points,
  these deployments typically have beefed up security and reliability. <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> is one of the few remaining growth areas in the depressed
  data networking sector, a fact not lost on vendors such as Cisco. Leading information
  technology services companies such as IBM have developed expertise integrating

<p class=MsoHeading8>Industrial Applications</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Manufacturers such as Boeing

<p class=MsoHeading8>Virtual ISPs</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The success of <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> shows
  that spectrum sharing works in the real world.  Without heavy-handed control
  by government or by service providers who have incentives to maximize only their
  own welfare, an entire industry has emerged. That industry has developed with
  no legal protections against competing uses. Despite repeated warnings of a
  “meltdown,” only isolated anecdotal cases of congestion among <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>

  devices become cheaper and more sophisticated every year, just like personal
  computers (but unlike most telecommunications services). They are standards-based
  components sold in a competitive market, at volumes that allow for economies
  of scale. Those new devices become part of the network as soon as users purchase
  and install them. Capital investment is spread among users, rather than shouldered
  upfront by a network operator. By contrast, 3G services can only be deployed
  after service providers build and upgrade expansive network infrastructure and
  proprietary hardware.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Limitations in <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> devices are being addressed through market forces. For
  example, first-generation <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> equipment has a relatively
  weak built-in security mechanism known as Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
  For users concerned about security, such as enterprises, third parties and hardware
  vendors quickly developed supplemental security solutions that integrated with
  standards-based <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> deployments. Meanwhile, an enhanced
  security standard, 802.1x, was recently ratified by the IEEE. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A key to the success of
  <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> is that it uses a different business model than traditional
  telecommunications and broadband services. Because the network grows incrementally
  with every new access point and every device capable of receiving <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>
  signals, there is no need for incentives to convince a monopoly service provider
  to build out expensive infrastructure. No one needs to predict what the killer
  applications of the technology will be, because users will find them on their
  own. With a licensed service, the network operator must invest in delivering
  services in the hope that customers will pay enough to recoup that investment.

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Unlicensed technologies could play an
  important role in residential broadband adoption. Today, incumbent cable and
  local telephone companies dominate the residential broadband market with cable
  modem and digital subscriber line (DSL) services. These companies control the
  two primary wires into homes. To deploy high-speed services, they must upgrade
  their <span class=GramE>networks, which requires</span> significant investment.
  Most incumbent service providers now charge $45 to $50 per month for broadband
  connections. They frequently place significant limitations on the services,
  including highly asymmetric bandwidth, prohibitions on home servers, prohibitions
  on virtual private network connections, and limits on streaming video usage.
  </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The operators claim these restrictions
  are necessary for their broadband offerings to be economically viable, even
  though equivalent services in other countries are priced significantly lower.
  Though <span
class=SpellE>subscribership</span> is increasing and new technologies are reducing
  the costs of broadband infrastructure, many companies have actually increased
  their prices during the past year, as competition dried up.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The fundamental problems in the residential
  broadband market are the same as in wireless. Service providers must build expensive
  networks and define the services for which they think users will pay, <span class=GramE>then</span>
  charge high rates to recover their costs. Most cable modem and DSL providers
  market their services as providing faster Web surfing than dial-up access. Many
  end-users simply don’t find this compelling, especially at $50 per month. Unlike
  the open <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> market, there is no room for innovators
  to roll out new service offerings or better technology, because everything must
  go through the network owner.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>As noted above, standard <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>
  technology provides only short-range connections, to a range of approximately
  300 feet. This is insufficient for most residential broadband deployments. To
  deliver broadband to a home, the home must connect to a high-speed Internet
  trunk, which can be shared among many customers. Having a fast <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> connection in a house doesn’t substitute for DSL or a
  cable modem, because the wired connection is still necessary to reach the public
  Internet. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Despite these limitations, there are several approaches
  that could allow unlicensed wireless devices to deliver last-mile broadband
  service. Companies such as Nokia (with its Rooftop system), <span
class=SpellE>MeshNetworks</span> and <span class=SpellE>SkyPilot</span> have created
  systems that use a meshed architecture. In other words, rather than connecting
  to a central hub, each device can send information to every other device it
  can see. Information can be routed through the network using many different
  paths, depending on capacity, line of sight, and other characteristics. The
  mesh approach gets around limitations that hobbled previous fixed-wireless systems
  in the last mile. Other companies such as <span
class=SpellE>Etherlinx</span> and Motorola have created proprietary technologies
  on top of <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> radios to allow significantly increased
  range in traditional point-to-multipoint deployments. Motorola claims its Canopy
  technology can serve up to 1,200 subscribers from a single access point at a
  range of up to two miles, operating in the unlicensed 5 GHz band. Unlicensed
  wireless connections could also serve as “tails” at the end of existing phone,
  cable, or fiber infrastructure in residential neighborhoods.  </p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>All these configurations have their limitations.
  As with any wireless service, connection quality depends on physical geography
  and the local spectral environment. As a result, <span class=GramE>it’s</span>
  unlikely unlicensed technologies would represent the majority of broadband connections
  in the near future. Even if they take a small share of the market, however,
  wireless last-mile systems would foster significant competition and innovation.
  Wired broadband providers would have to improve their offerings or lower costs
  to compete. </span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Demand
  Pull</span></b></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Unlicensed wireless technologies will
  impact the broadband market even if they aren’t used as the primary connection
  method. Large numbers of <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> access points are being
  deployed for home networking. Users install these devices in their homes to
  share broadband connections among several computers, share peripherals such
  as printers, or give themselves <span class=SpellE>untethered</span> Internet
  access anywhere in their house. Digital consumer electronics devices are beginning
  to incorporate <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> connections as well. For example,
  <span class=SpellE>Moxi</span> Digital, which recently merged with <span class=SpellE>Digeo</span>,
  a company funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, incorporates an 802.11a
  transmitter in its personal media center. This allows the <span class=SpellE>Moxi</span>
  box to stream high-quality audio video among TVs and stereos throughout a house.
  Intel is spearheading a standards effort to allow <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>
  to interoperate with FireWire (IEEE 1394), a wired standard popular for digital
  media applications.</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>As home networks and related devices proliferate, they will
  create a “pull” for broadband applications. <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span> hardware
  is becoming sufficiently cheap for hardware manufacturers to include it without
  significant effects on device prices. As users buy laptops and consumer electronics
  hardware with high-speed wireless connections built in, they will find new uses
  for it, such as sending music files from their computer to their stereo system,
  or sharing pictures downloaded from the Web. Many of these applications will
  benefit from broadband connections into the home. Wireless devices will therefore
  stimulate broadband demand even when the last-mile connection is wired.<a name="_Toc17533084"></a></p>

  Technologies now available or under development will lay the groundwork for
  a radically more open and more efficient wireless environment, but without the
  right policy framework, those technologies may never see the light of day. <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>,
  exciting though it may be, cannot simply evolve into the full realization of
  open spectrum. If the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> wants to enjoy the benefits of open spectrum, it
  must take steps to facilitate it.  </span></p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First,
  Do No Harm</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Despite the promise of open spectrum, there are
  many threats to the continued growth of unlicensed wireless. Open spectrum profoundly
  threatens the status quo. It represents a new form of potential competition
  for existing wireless services, and for wired services as well. Moreover, it
  runs counter to conventional assumptions about which policies are truly market-based.
  Absent a clear understanding of open spectrum’s implications, policymakers may
  take actions that would prevent it from reaching its potential.  The FCC and
  Congress must ensure that the following threats from incumbent industries do
  not undermine the future potential of unlicensed technologies:</p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Requests for Regulatory Protection</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Sirius Satellite Radio filed a petition with the
  FCC earlier this year seeking restrictions on <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> based on trumped-up concerns about interference with
  its adjacent licensed satellite transmissions. Though Sirius hadn’t even launched
  its service and the potential for interference was minimal, it wanted significant
  limitations and new device requirements placed on the thriving <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> industry. The Sirius petition was withdrawn after it
  provoked serious objections. Nonetheless, it gives a sense of how licensed users
  could seek to hamstring unlicensed alternatives. Wireless operators facing new
  competition from unlicensed devices may similarly rely on scare tactics and
  legal maneuvers to prevent unlicensed services from encroaching on their markets.
</p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Spectrum “<span class=SpellE>Propertization</span>”</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>If the FCC were to give spectrum licensees full
  ownership rights, it would significantly decrease the likelihood that spectrum
  would be available for unlicensed uses. Companies that pay for control over
  frequencies will want to recoup their investments, which means excluding competing
  users.  Even if “band managers” could operate toll-gated frequencies for unlicensed
  use, the transaction costs involved would be substantial.  Worst of all, <span class=SpellE>propertization</span>
  is a one-way street. Once spectrum becomes private property, converting some
  of it to unlicensed “parks” or even eliminating restrictions on band sharing
  could require costly eminent domain proceedings. Giving spectrum licensees greater
  flexibility or opportunities to engage in secondary market transactions may
  make sense, but the step from there to further <span class=SpellE>propertization</span>
  would have significant negative consequences.</p>
<p class=MsoHeading8>Backhaul Discrimination</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>Unlicensed wireless data devices must at some point
  connect into the public Internet. For traditional point-to-multipoint systems
  such as <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>, an access point serves as the local
  hub and connects to a wired data connection such as a T-1 line to deliver traffic
  to the Internet. Bringing data from a local point of presence to a central aggregation
  point is known as “backhaul.” It typically involves facilities of incumbent
  local exchange carriers, because their networks span virtually every city. Because
  of the lack of competition, backhaul is expensive. Moreover, if telephone companies
  see unlicensed wireless devices as competitive, they may seek to prevent them
  from connecting into their networks.  An advantage of meshed networks and systems
  that combine short-range unlicensed “tails” with long-range unlicensed “backbones”
  is that they cut down on the need for wired backhaul connections. Until such
  alternatives are widely available, the government should reject rule changes
  that would make it easier for telephone companies to discriminate in provision
  of wireless backhaul, and should police against anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<h2 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Affirmative
  Steps</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>At the same time, policymakers should
  take affirmative steps to facilitate open spectrum. Most current unlicensed
  wireless services, including <span class=SpellE>WiFi</span>, operate in the
  2.4 GHz and 5 GHz unlicensed bands. These bands are relatively narrow, at high
  frequencies that limit their propagation, and subject to many established competing
  uses. Though unlicensed devices can coexist in seemingly crowded spectrum, their
  ability to do so is not absolute. Moreover, <span class=SpellE>WiFi’s</span>
  software protocols don’t have the adaptive and cooperative characteristics of
  truly scalable unlicensed networks. Current FCC rules have done a reasonable
  job of setting conditions that allow for innovation and market growth, but more
  is needed. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>All of the elements are important. <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span>, other unlicensed technologies in designated bands, and

  Existing unlicensed bands are delivering value today. However, newer approaches
  designed from the ground up for open spectrum will be the long-term winners.

<p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The first step is to enhance
  existing unlicensed bands, which were not designed with open spectrum in mind.
  The FCC should work with the private sector and the technical community to identify
  minimal requirements to facilitate efficient spectrum sharing. In the near term,
  this could include service rules for the 5 GHz band to allow for continued growth
  of wireless data networking applications. These should not pre-determine technology
  or applications, but could include general requirements such as mandating that
  devices be capable of two-way packet-switched communications. The FCC should
  also identify restrictions in its existing rules, such as outmoded prohibitions
  on <span class=GramE>repeaters, that</span> could be removed to allow for greater
  spectrum sharing.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the future, as it establishes
  new unlicensed bands and eliminates underlay restrictions, the FCC could define
  additional “rules of the road,” either as requirements or as advisory “best
  practices.” For example, companies could be encouraged to build devices that
  modulate their output based on actual conditions, or that repeat traffic for
  other users, allowing for meshed architectures.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever rules are adopted
  should be developed in consultation with industry representatives and technical
  experts to ensure they do not over- or under-specify standards. Reasonable accommodations
  should be made for uses of spectrum other than data networking, including scientific
  activity such as radio astronomy. Different rules may apply to particular bands
  or techniques. Whatever decisions are made will need to be reviewed periodically
  as conditions evolve. </span></p>

  bands isn’t enough. Most are so narrow and congested that their utility for
  open spectrum is limited. Furthermore, the high frequency of the most prominent
  unlicensed bands limits signal propagation. Lower-frequency spectrum that penetrates

<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The FCC took a major step forward with
  its February approval of ultra-wideband. The Commission wisely rejected overblown
  fears about interference, relying on technical data and prudent restrictions
  on UWB deployment. However, the Commission’s initial rules still put unnecessarily
  severe limits on where and how UWB can be used. Assuming that experience shows
  the fears about interference ungrounded, the FCC should loosen its restrictions
  without delay.<i></i></span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The FCC should look at
  other ways to facilitate underlay of unlicensed communications in existing spectrum
  bands. Underlay can be achieved either through weak signals or adaptive, agile
  receivers. As technology advances, the FCC could consider a rule allowing underlay
  in certain bands, so long as devices check the local environment before transmitting
  and vacate a frequency within a certain number of milliseconds if a licensed
  service appears there. Underlay could also be used as a transition mechanism
  in bands where there are limited numbers of incumbents. Those incumbents could
  be allowed to remain in the band, but without the current guarantees against
  interference. </span></p>

  Development and Adoption</span></h2>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The government should seek out additional
  mechanisms to encourage the development and deployment of unlicensed devices.
  These could include liberalizing rules for experimental licenses, funding research
  projects, and using government procurement power to drive adoption of <span
class=SpellE>WiFi</span> or other technologies. The Defense Advanced Research
  Projects Agency (DARPA) of the Department of Defense has a distinguished history
  of supporting cutting-edge research in data networking, including the packet-switching
  technology that led to the Internet. DARPA has long funded research into meshed
  wireless networking, ultra-wideband, and software-defined radio, because of
  their military applications. These efforts should be continued, and every effort
  made to ensure smooth transfer of the resulting technologies to civilian applications.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>The FCC and other relevant agencies should
  review their rules to identify unnecessary restrictions that keep unlicensed
  devices out of existing programs. For example, the FCC doesn’t allow the use
  of Schools and Libraries subsidies for unlicensed networking devices, because
  they do not involve a communications “service.” Of course, government should
  not try to pick winners among competitors in the marketplace, but rather work
  in tandem with the private sector to ensure innovative technologies can reach
  their potential.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Alongside these steps,
  the FCC and Congress should continue their broader efforts to foster investment
  and competition in communications. Open spectrum will flourish in a growing
  market.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The forthcoming return
  of analog television spectrum provides an opportunity to put some of these policies
  into practice. Congress has directed the FCC to auction the 700 MHz spectrum
  now occupied by broadcast channels 60-69, though the auction has been delayed
  several times. Because of its propagation characteristics, the 700 MHz spectrum
  could make an excellent unlicensed wireless park, a scenario that simply could
  not be contemplated when the original plans for return of that spectrum were
  drawn up. Congress should take advantage of the opportunity and designate some
  or <span class=GramE>all of the</span> 700 MHz spectrum for unlicensed devices.
  As a transitional mechanism, the FCC could allow only underlay uses that do
  not intrude on i<a name="_Toc17533091">ncumbent licensees. </a></span></p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We are living under a faulty
  set of assumptions about spectrum. Licensing may have been the only viable approach
  in the 1920s, but it certainly isn’t in the first years of the 21st century.
  We take it for granted that companies must pay for exclusive rights to spectrum,
  and that once they do, they must invest in significant infrastructure <span class=SpellE>buildout</span>
  to deliver services. We also take for granted a pervasive level of regulation
  on how spectrum is used, which would be intolerable for any other medium so
  connected to speech. We assume that market forces, if introduced into the wireless
  world at all, must be applied to choices among monopolists rather than free
  competition. We make these assumptions because we can’t imagine the world being

  about wireless communication. By making more efficient use of the spectrum we
  have, it can effectively remove the capacity constraints that limit current
  wireless voice and data services. By opening up space for innovation, it could
  lead to the development of new applications and services. It could provide an
  alternative pipe into the home for broadband connectivity. And it could allow
  many more speakers access to the public resource of the airwaves.</span></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Today, we stand at a crucial point. Our policies
  could fritter away open spectrum’s historic opportunity, either through inaction
  or harmful limits on new technologies. Or we could listen to what the market
  and <span
class=GramE>technology are</span> telling us. Computers have made wireless devices
  vastly smarter than they were in the past. It’s time for our policies to become
  smarter as well. Promoting open spectrum is the most democratic, deregulatory,
  pro-investment, and innovation-friendly move the US Government could make.</span></p>
