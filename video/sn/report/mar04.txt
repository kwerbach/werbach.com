A big issue this month, on topics ranging from politics to wireless
technology. What can I say -- there's a lot happening out there! I've
also included the prepared text of my oral testimony last month before
the Senate Commerce Committee, which held an important hearing on the
policy implications of voice over IP (VOIP). The VOIP debate won't
just affect new service providers like Vonage; it will shape the
playing field for the new wave of broadband applications. And that in
turn will shape future business opportunities in communications,
software, and media.

The important connections between seemingly unrelated developments in
these industries are becoming increasingly clear. As the discussion
below about commoditization shows, the record labels aren't the only
ones facing significant challenges in an era of pervasive digital
networks. Increasingly, everything is connected. This has radical
consequences, which we are just starting to appreciate.

If you're at all interested in these topics, I hope you'll join me in
June at Supernova <http://www.supernova2004.com/>. The topics we'll
discuss have never been more business-relevant. And I've never seen a
greater array of startups building on the opportunities that
decentralized connectivity offers.

TELECOM
The End of Spectrum Scarcity

That's the title of an article I co-wrote with Greg Staple, a
Washington telecom lawyer, in the new issue of IEEE Spectrum magazine.

http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/mar04/0304scar.html

We explain how "open spectrum" technologies could, with the right
regulatory decisions, massively increase the usable capacity for
wireless communication.  More spectrum is also coming from
conventional sources like reallocation.

It's hard to overstate how big a deal this could be.  Cingular just
spent $41 billion for AT&T Wireless, allegedly because it desperately
needed more spectrum.  And we're not even imagining the applications
and usage scenarios that will develop when wireless capacity goes from
being expensive and scarce to virtually free like computer cycles.

SOFTWARE
The Commoditization Challenge


Eli Noam of Columbia Business School wrote an important column in the
Financial Times <http://biz.yahoo.com/ft/040217/1075982580712_1.html>
pointing out the fundamental business challenge facing the tech
sector: commoditization.

His conclusion: "The market failure of the entire information sector
is one of the fundamental trends of our time, with far-reaching long-
term effects, and it is happening right in front of our eyes."

Eli is by nature a cynic, so what he has to say is often not pleasant.
But he has the unfortunate habit of being right much of the time, and
ahead of the curve virtually all the time. I've disagreed with some of
his conclusions, but I'm with him on the core insight: there is a
basic structural disconnect in the economics of information
industries, with painful consequences. We saw it first in telecom,
where VOIP is now bringing the issue to a boil, but it's broader than
that. It's ultimately about software, which is just a collection of
commodity bits replacing proprietary hardware and systems.

Jeff Jarvis and Ross Mayfield (see links below) would like to think we
can make it up on volume - the point to microcontent ventures like
Nick Denton's blog network, which are springing up at the feet of the
collapsing dinosaurs. I'm as excited as they are about new bottom-up
markets. The problem is simply that you can't get there from here. A
hundred Nick Dentons wouldn't pay for one floor of the Conde Nast
headquarters building where Jeff works. (Jeff knows that, and is
working both sides of the equation, but Gawker will never be
Entertainment Weekly.) There's no scenario that doesn't take a
substantial amount of money from the traditional media sector -- and
telecom, and IT -- and replace with a smaller amount of money in
distributed alternatives.

One answer, which Noam thinks may be inevitable, is consolidation to
the point of monopolization. Ma Bell held back the tide of
commoditization in an industry characterized by high fixed and low
variable costs, and Microsoft is doing the same thing in the PC
business. That outcome isn't all bad... but it's far from good. And, I
believe, far from assured.

Is there another answer? I think there is. I proposed it four years
ago in the Harvard Business Review (and a year earlier in Release
1.0): syndication. (See <http://werbach.com/docs/syndication.pdf>.) At
the time, the idea may have sounded like new economy hype. In reality,
syndication is a roadmap for pulling out of the commoditization death
spiral. It won't be simple and it won't be painless, but syndication
will provide a foundation for new growth in the information sector.
Just look at the performance of the two Web-based companies most
heavily built on the syndication model: Google and Amazon. Another
useful test case for syndication will be the development of the
RSS/RDF/Atom ecosystem around Weblogs.

POLITICS
The Last Internet Campaign?

Clay Shirky's coda for the Dean campaign <http://tinyurl.com/2bqtu>
hits the nail on the head:

"We are seeing the last internet campaign. The advantage of having the
Dean story play so big is that everyone was watching. None of this was
lost on Karl Rove, or on Terry McAuliffe. Given what Dean was able to
do with internet tools, they will become a key part of the fall
campaign, and so completely integral by 2008 that they won't rate more
than a mention, much less a cover story in the NY Times magazine."

The interesting question, though, is what a successful Internet
campaign would look like.  Dean showed how the Net can take an obscure
candidate and vault him to the head of the pack.  What would a real
Internet campaign by an establishment figure like John Kerry -- or
George W. Bush -- look like?  We'll see beta versions this fall, but
they will almost certainly be copies of Dean's techniques rather than
real innovations.

I have a hunch that the first Internet campaign to truly mobilize
voters on a mass scale (as opposed to fundraising and core supporters)
won't start around a candidate.  One of the key, and under-
appreciated, elements of Dean's early success was MoveOn.org.  MoveOn
never actually endorsed Dean, but its tactics and worldview were
aligned with the Dean campaign. Its early online poll was the first
demonstration of Dean's "front-runner" status.  MoveOn, thanks to help
from friends like George Soros, will be significant player in the Fall
campaign.  Yet MoveOn wasn't started to elect a President; it was
started to defend a President (Clinton) against impeachment efforts.

What most people really support are causes, not candidates.  The cause
many Dean supporters were passionate about was defeating President
Bush, and that ultimately came back to haunt Howard Dean in the form
of "electability."  The power of the Net in politics, as Clay and
others have eloquently written, is its ability to lower coordination
barriers among large numbers of people.  Thus, it's most effective
where people already support a cause.

It's hard to remember now, but back in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
there were two such causes: health care reform and deficit reduction.
The health care debate was co-opted by the traditional players, but on
the deficit side, the Concord Coalition did an amazing job of
mobilizing popular anger, largely among young people, about the
ruinous course of our fiscal policies.  And they did it without any of
the Internet-based tools groups like MoveOn are exploiting today.

So yes, we've seen the last Internet campaign, but not the first
Internet President.  That will have to wait for a movement that starts
outside the existing political boxes, and a candidate able to make the
most of it.

TELECOM
The Battle for VOIP Begins

On February 13, 2004, the FCC declared Pulver.com's Free World Dialup
service an unregulated information service, and launched a proceeding
seeking comment on the treatment of voice over IP more broadly. This
is the first step in the crucial process of establishing the
regulatory framework for the telecom industry of the future.

At the FCC meeting, Chairman Powell said something to the effect that
this is the most important proceeding in the history of communications
regulation, and he's right.  There has been intense political back-
and-forth on these issues behind the scenes, with Congressional
leaders and the FBI pushing hard on the FCC.  The Commissioners and
the staffers drafting the items worked through the night to reach
compromises.  The meeting was pushed back from 9:30 to 11am and the
VOIP items were moved the end of the agenda, no doubt to allow time
for final rewriting.

It is vitally important that the tech community participate in the
VOIP proceeding.  The decisions the FCC makes will determine not just
how new VOIP providers like Vonage and Packet8 are treated, but the
rules of the road for the broadband superhighway.  As I said at the
FCC VOIP hearing in December, voice is now an application.  It's one
of many applications that will be delivered through interconnected
broadband networks.  The FCC's actions will determine the business
environment for network operators, application providers, and content
creators.  This is the whole enchilada.

When the text of the notice is released, we'll know the exact comment
deadlines and questions being asked.  FCC proceedings are open to
anyone -- you don't have to be a lawyer or a company in the space, and
you can file via a Web form.  (One of my proudest accomplishments from
my time at the Commission.)

To get a sense of what's at stake here, consider the comments of Wall
Street analyst Anna-Maria Kovacs. Anna-Maria has long been one of the
few Wall Street analysts to really understand the FCC regulatory
process and its implications for the telecom industry. In the note
ahead of the FCC meeting, she nailed the crucial business implications
of the VOIP regulation debate.

Here's a quote from her conclusion:

	If the application vendors can ride free and the telco
	and cable network providers are not allowed to block them,
	then the application vendors will have a huge cost advantage
	vis-à-vis the carriers they ride. The carriers will have both
	network and marketing costs, while the pure application
	vendors	will only have marketing costs. In such an
	environment, the guest's end-user rates can be much lower than
	those of the host.

	The problem would be most extreme for the telcos, who have an
	existing revenue base at risk and who lack video revenues to
	help support at least a portion of their network. But even the
	cable-network providers would be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis
	the pure application vendors.

	The good news would be lots more end-user choices and lower
	prices. The bad news would be the threat to the financial
	viability of the underlying carriers who make that competition
	possible.

What Anna-Maria has realized is that the VOIP debate is about two
visions for the future of the Internet. James Seng captured the point
well in his layers diagram, which you can find at
<http://james.seng.cc/archives/000301.html>. This has been a recurring
theme in my writings over the past few years. Vision 1 presumes that
applications will be tied to connectivity platforms. Vision 2
innovation and economic activity booming when those layers are de-
linked. (In case you're unclear, I believe in Vision 2.)

Naive proponents of Vision 1, like the Wall Street Journal editorial
page, simply ignore the lessons of the Internet and telecom
competition over the past two decades. The best case that can be made
for tying applications to network infrastructure is the one Kovacs
lays out: it's the only way to pay for the network. The critical
question is the one raised in her last sentence: whether the network
is financial viable based on connectivity revenues alone. (Anna-Maria
is just setting out the possibilities; I don't know whether or not she
believes this viewpoint is accurate.)

I'm convinced that network operators can do quite well based on their
access revenues alone, without any need to suck value out of the
application and content layers. The hard part will be replacing legacy
infrastructure and shifting to a new cost structure. The Bells spend
tens of billions of dollars each year on capital expenditures, and
turning that oil tanker around won't be easy.

Yet, it can be done. In his speech recently to the New America
Foundation, AT&T CEO Dave Dorman described some of the pain AT&T has
gone through over the past five years in migrating from five separate
networks to one massive IP network. It's a multi-billion dollar annual
project, which is still ongoing. But AT&T believes that pain is
necessary to position itself for the emerging all-IP, converged
telecom world. I think they are dead on.

The incumbent local phone companies haven't yet made the same
commitment AT&T has. Instead, they are pushing a vision that removes
the pressure for change.

TELECOM
My Testimony at the Senate Voice Over IP Hearing
February 24, 2004

Full statement available at <http://werbach.com/docs/senatevoip.html>


Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Commerce Committee, thank you for the
opportunity to testify on the implications of voice over Internet
protocol technology.

I am the founder of the Supernova Group, an independent technology
analysis and consulting firm.  Earlier in my career, I had the honor
of serving as Counsel for New Technology Policy at the Federal
Communications Commission.  I participated in the FCC's efforts,
starting nearly a decade ago, to understand a phenomenon we called
"Internet telephony."

I'm here to tell you that VOIP presents tremendous opportunities for
the US economy and the American people.  As my written statement
explains in more detail, we are witnessing the most significant change
in telecommunications since Alexander Graham Bell called out for Mr.
Watson.

Historically, telephony and other services like broadcasting were tied
to specific infrastructure and regulatory regimes.  The service was
the network.

In the converged digital world, however, there is one network of
networks, the Internet, bound together with common technical
protocols.  Instead of data as a service delivered through a voice-
oriented telephone network, voice is becoming a class of applications
on top of data networks. To a data network, a voice call is nothing
more than an instant message with different latency and reliability
characteristics.

[Hold up Grandstream device]

Consider this device.  It may look like a phone, but it's actually a
data terminal for voice over broadband service.  It has an Ethernet
port on the back, rather than an RJ-11 phone jack.  Should regulatory
obligations depend on the shape of a jack?

[Hold up Motorola ATA]

How about this?  It doesn't look like a phone at all.  But it's
essentially the same device as the previous one, just without a
keypad, microphone, or speakers.  This is the Motorola box Vonage gave
me as part of its VOIP service.

[Hold up laptop]

Now, I don't think anyone here would call this a phone.  But if I load
a piece of software called a softphone client onto this laptop, and
plug in a simple headset, it becomes a voice communications end-point.

If I then use the laptop to call my friends, who is the service
provider that would be subject to regulation?  The software vendor?
The laptop manufacturer?  My broadband provider?  What if I'm online
through a WiFi wireless hotspot in a Starbucks, and the softphone
client is running on my handheld personal digital assistant?

And it doesn't end there.  I can buy a $50 Webcam, and use it to
engage in multi-point voice and video-conferencing with other computer
users around the world.  Or I can subscribe to the online services
associated with Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox video game
consoles, and chat live with other players.  Both applications use
voice over IP.  Even the push-to-talk services cellular operators are
deploying generally employ VOIP.

As these examples show, VOIP is much more than services that may look
similar to traditional circuit-switched voice telephony.  Trying to
separate out unregulated from regulated VOIP applications will prove
to be an impossible exercise.

Engineers use the concept of layering to describe how data networks
operate.  The underlying physical transmission is a separate layer
from higher-level functions, just as cars are separate from the
highways they drive on.

A layered approach to communications regulation would distinguish
among content, applications, addressing, and physical transmission.
Open and non-discriminatory connectivity between those layers ensures
innovation and competitive deployment of new applications.

In considering the policy concerns we've been asked to address, we
must step back and examine the point of existing regulatory
obligations and taxes.  And then we must adapt our policy approaches
to reflect the changes sweeping the industry.

The current systems of universal service funding and inter-carrier
compensation must be reformed if universal service is to endure.  Such
reforms will only succeed if all parties have a reason to come to the
table. It would be a sad irony if our attempts to impose universal
service obligations on VOIP limited deployment of technologies that
can help bring affordable advanced communications capabilities to all
Americans.

For social policy obligations such as law enforcement access, consumer
protection, and emergency services, voluntary industry efforts now
underway should be given an opportunity to succeed, before regulators
and Congress should consider the need for targeted action.

With VOIP, we are seeing the Internet realize its destiny.  We can
embrace that future, or we can try to pull the Internet back into
yesterday's regulatory system.

Make no mistake.  Broad-brush regulation of VOIP is tantamount to
regulation of Internet applications.  From the network's perspective,
a stream of voice bits is no different from an eBay auction or a
Google search.

If the US is to remain the leader in the information-driven global
economy of the 21st century, we must continue our enlightened policies
to favor innovation and competitive markets, while remaining committed
to our essential social goals.

MEDIA
The Free Culture Debate

Over at the Progress and Freedom Foundation blog, James DeLong
attempts to prove that the "Free Culture Movement" (FCM) led by people
like Larry Lessig is part and parcel of the political left:

"The FCM does not think that production and consumption of
intellectual creations should be organized by property rights and
markets. Instead, it favors a mechanism of production based on the
open source software movement...."  <http://tinyurl.com/3eha6>

This is a nice case of simply asserting what the author is allegedly
attempting to prove. In fact, Free Culture is eminently consistent
with markets and property rights. Lessig's Creative Commons and
successful open source projects are based on well-defined software
licenses. In other words, property rights that function in a market.
The network infrastructure piece of Free Culture, open spectrum, is
expressly built on the idea of a market in wireless devices replacing
a system of government spectrum micro-management. And it was the
Framers of the US Constitution, hardly anti-property radicals, who
decreed that copyrights be for a limited period of time.

The property rights maximalists are the true radicals here. They have
defined any challenges to the status quo as a frontal attack on
property rights. As political propaganda, this effort may have some
success. But the ultimate strength of the Free Culture Movement, or
whatever one calls it, lies in this: It is an internal critique of the
dominant ideology, not an external challenge to markets like
communism.

The Free Culture proponents, who offer suggestions like returning to
the copyright terms of the 1790s, are the true conservatives in this
debate.

When I posted these thoughts on my blog, James DeLong was kind enough
to respond.  He stepped back from his earlier statements and
acknowledged that, yes, there are elements of the movement, such as
Creative Commons, that work within the property rights system.  For
that I give him credit.

I don't agree with his stark division of the FCM into "BSD Licence"
activities that respect property rights and "GPL" activities that seek
to overthrow them, but I won't be ungrateful.  It's a much more
nuanced and accurate view that what he started with.  If we can spend
our energy debating the substance of the issues -- which sets of rules
better promote economic efficiency, freedom, and innovation -- we may
make some progress.

To my mind, the genius of people like Larry Lessig and Yochai Benkler
is that, unlike the prior "copyleft" generation represented by GPL
creator Richard Stallman, they are able to engage on their opponents'
own turf as well as from the outside.  What set me off about DeLong's
original post was the unwillingness to accept that fact, by labeling
the whole movement as opposed to property rights.

DeLong takes umbrage at my use of the term "copyright maximalists."
First of all, I didn't apply that label to him -- I was thinking more
of Jack Valenti. As DeLong makes clear in his followup post, he
appreciates that property rights have limits:

"It is clear as a matter of historical experience and common sense
that property rights get cut and trimmed to fit the technological and
transaction-cost realities of the age."

Unfortunately, many of the business and political interests in the
digital content debates fail to acknowledge this point.  The movie
industry, for example, has vociferously promoted its conception of its
intellectual property rights as morally sacrosanct, now and forever.
One key rhetorical move they make in doing so is to label anyone who
questions their viewpoint as a communist and/or a pirate.  (I'm not
sure which is the greater insult.)  You either support the Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act... or you're in the dustbin of history
with Lenin and Trotsky.  In a political battle, demonizing the
opposition can be very effective.

I'm sure this wasn't what motivated DeLong's original post.  But to a
reader, his sweeping generalization had that ring.

De Long succinctly (if inadvertently) shows the core problem:

"The FCM should be making important contributions to the process of
redefinition, but so far what we hear from it is why property rights
are bad, in whatever context happens to be under discussion at the
moment, except, perhaps, for the spectrum problem mentioned by
Werbach."

I see a similar problem on the other side: property rights defenders
reflexively attacking alternative production models and technology-
necessitated limitations on rights.  Does that describe all opponents
of the FCM?  Of course not.  But the thoughtful ones such as DeLong
are letting themselves become intellectual cover for the extremists.

That's why this meta-debate matters.  In the confines of the academy,
we all trust each other's intellectual honesty and can have a nice
conversation.  DeLong points to Polk Wagner, who has done excellent
work attacking the point of view that I support.  I see Polk once a
month at a Philly-area gathering of cyberlaw aficionados.  We find
common ground on some substantive points and disagree on others, but I
always respect his perspective.  In my forthcoming spectrum paper, I
engage with other brilliant scholars like Howard Shelanski and Stuart
Benjamin who have written in the area.  That's the nature of
intellectual debate -- different sides advance claims and challenge
one another.

The cold reality is that the Free Culture battle isn't just being
fought in the halls of academe.  The scholarly discussion is part of a
larger debate taking place in Congress, the courts, corporate board
rooms, and the realm of public opinion.  We simply can't ignore the
consequences of labeling opponents with too broad brush.
