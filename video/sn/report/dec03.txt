Here's the crux of his argument:	"At the behest of powerful interests, the FCC is buying into a	warped vision that open networks should be replaced by closed	networks and that the FCC should excuse broadband providers	from longstanding non-discrimination requirements."I'm also growing increasingly concerned about the direction the FCC istaking. Just as broadband deployment is taking off, and newapplications as VOIP are beginning to thrive on top of the broadbandplatform, the FCC is moving to tilt the rules of the game away frominnovators and toward incumbents.I have great respect for FCC Chairman Powell's intelligence andintegrity, and as I've written (http://slate.msn.com/id/2078879/), Idon't see him as a mindless tool of big business. He is one of the fewpeople in Washington who sees the coming transformation of telecom forwhat it is.The problem is that the FCC doesn't seem to fully appreciate what"voice is just an application" implies. It means broadband transportand what rides on top are separate markets. Competition on top dependson open connectivity to what lies beneath. As much as the companiescontrolling last-mile infrastructure have complained, they have madethe investments and successfully built broadband access businessesunder the current pro-competitive FCC rules. Yet now they insist theywon't invest without the ability to control what happens at theapplication and content layers.The incumbents (and, it seems, the FCC) have it exactly backwards.Today, we don't need a new set of incentives for companies to deliverbroadband transport; we need incentives to create broadbandapplications. And competition is the best possible incentive.Competition at the application layer will stimulate demand for morebandwidth at the physical layer. That's how we'll catch up to placeslike Japan and Korea that are rolling out 27 and 50 megabit broadbandconnections. Giving up on competition in applications in the hope thatthe bottleneck transport providers will deploy bundled services makesno sense. It runs counter to all the lessons we should have learnedfrom the success of the narrowband Internet.Openness isn't some abstract principle invented by Larry Lessig tojustify new regulation; it's a particular technical and policyframework that is deeply embedded in the Internet and existing FCCrules. The Internet is open not through government mandates, butbecause it is architected to avoid the need for them.  Companies cancompete vigorously, because no matter how successful they become,others can still overtake them.That vital, unregulated space, however, rides on top of physicaltransport networks subject to very different economics.  At best, thebroadband last mile is a duopoly.  For many Americans like myself whocan't get either cable modem or DSL service, it's a monopoly.  I hopeand expect that will change, largely due to innovation in wireless.But let's not kid ourselves.  It will be years before any alternatebroadband access platform has the reach and capabilities of cable ortelephone wires.The genius of the Internet's design is that it abstracts out thatphysical infrastructure.  The Internet starts with IP, which can runon any digital network.  The genius of the FCC's Computer Inquiryrules, first adopted in their present form in 1980 and embedded in the1996 Telecommunication Act, is that they adopt the same approach.Underlying basic services are differentiated from competitiveinformation services.  Bottleneck transport networks must provide openinterconnection and must not restrict user choice of applications,devices, and content. From there, everyone can compete on a levelplaying field.It's important to understand that this open connectivity model isfundamentally deregulatory.  It's not a new form of regulatoryinterventionism, as opponents often suggest.  It's about opening upnew minimally regulated spaces for competition and innovation on topof the bottleneck physical infrastructure.  That competition andinnovation, in turn, will stimulate deployment and competitive entryat lower levels.  Hence, the dynamism of the Internet spurred cableoperators to invest in building a second broadband access platforminto the home, which in turn forced local phone companies to invest inDSL.The argument incumbents are making today is that the Internet model isa failure.  The only business model that will work for broadband, theyclaim, is the cable TV model: one provider controlling both access andcontent.  Without incentives to create such walled gardens, they say,they won't invest in building out their infrastructure.I'm not ready to pick winners yet.  I think the FCC should maintainand adapt its long-standing open connectivity model for the emergingbroadband world.======================================================================----------------------------------------------------------------------Save the date...S U P E R N O V A   2 0 0 4June 24-25, 2004San Francisco Bay Areahttp://www.pulver.com/supernova/Supernova will once again bring together cutting-edge entrepreneurs,technologists, executives, and thinkers to explore thedecentralization of software, communications, and media.

Esther andPierre don't need LinkedIn to reach pretty much anyone they want tocontact.  Yet there are a whole lot of folks who want to reach them,and don't have a personal connection to do so.  So the service worsenstheir email overload with little corresponding benefit. I'm somewhatin the same boat.  I'm certainly not as well-known as Esther andPierre, but I have a pretty good network in the tech industry.  Ihaven't yet found a situation where LinkedIn got me to someone Icouldn't reach directly, by Googling for an email address, or byguessing a mutual connection.The challenge for the services is that network effects work againstthem.  Sure, there are probably situations in which Bill Gates wouldget some utility out of a social networking service.  However, thetotal value he receives is one-thousandth or less of the value otherswould perceive in having a direct line to the chairman of Microsoft.The burden of fending off unwanted requests (for billg and his directconnections) will far exceed the benefit Gates enjoys.  So he'sunlikely to use the service.Now, imagine people distributed along a bell curve, with Bill Gates onone end and some poor helpless schmoe on the other.  Those on the"low" side of the curve will use the service to reach those on the"high" side of the curve.  Given the power-law distribution of socialnetworks, the most popular recipients will be bombarded with requests.Many of them will opt out, transferring the burden to the next-highestpeople remaining, and so forth.Sure, there will be exceptions.  The point is that the people whoseparticipation creates the most value for the network as a whole arethe least likely to stay connected.The second problem is that the social networking services don't have afield for "do I really know this individual personally?"  Havingsomeone's email address in Outlook isn't necessarily a proxy for arelationship.  The other day I got a request through Spoke to forwardan invitation to Paul Krugman, the New York Times columnist.  I knewboth the sender and the next person in the chain, and the request wasreasonable, so I forwarded it on.  The recipient wrote back to saythat his only link to Krugman was sending him one email last yearcommenting on a column.  Krugman never responded.  Not exactly a"trusted connection."If these services really want to be useful for business networking,they will have to incorporate features that add more granularity andcontrol.  The challenge is that doing so requires more effort on thepart of the participants, which mitigates the benefits the servicesprovide in the first place.I should add that, after I posted some of these thoughts on my weblog,I received emails from the founders of both LinkedIn and Spoke,defending their services.  LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman pointed out thathis service requires affirmative steps to initiate and accept anyconnection.  Spoke co-founder Chris Tolles noted that a highpercentage of their users are in fact CEOs or other executives,possibly because they use the service to extend their network to theirpartners and employees.  However, both of them agreed with my pointabout the need for more granularity and user control.I remain both skeptical and optimistic about social networking. On theone hand, it's an exciting area that is putting into practice some ofthe ideas about self-organization and decentralized networking thatI've written about and explored at Supernova. On the other hand, Idon't believe any of the existing services has yet proven that it cangenerate enough value, and make enough money, to succeed over the longhaul. I'll keep watching the space and hoping someone proves myskepticism wrong.----------------------------------------------------------------------TELECOMRemarks to FCC VOIP Forum -- December 1, 2003(As prepared; slides at http://werbach.com/docs/FCC_VOIP.ppt)[I was invited to testify at a major FCC hearing on voiceover IP, which the Commission plans to address in a rulemakingproceeding early next year. Details of the forum are at<http://www.fcc.gov/voip>. Below is my opening statement.]Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners.   It's a pleasure to beback at  the FCC, and especially a pleasure to be discussing VoiceOver IP.  If you read the popular press, you would think VOIP justrecently burst on the scene. Yet not only has VOIP been around fornearly a decade, it has been under consideration at the FCC for almostthat entire time.  Seven-and-a-half years ago, a group called ACTAfiled a petition asking the FCC to ban unregulated VOIP.  TheCommission was absolutely right to decline ACTA's request -- andsubsequent invitations -- to impose the full panoply of traditionaltelecom regulation on a nascent technology.However, it's no longer 1996.  Where once the threat was unjustifiedFCC action, now it is FCC inaction.  If the Commission does notsquarely confront the questions VOIP raises, it will inadvertentlyallow legacy regulation and regulatory uncertainty to stiflecompetition and innovation.  The reason is that, again, again contraryto what you might read in the papers, VOIP isn't just a creative trickto avoid regulation.  It's a reflection of the fundamental way thatcommunications is changing in a digital broadband world.[SLIDE 2] The FCC's traditional regulatory model classifies servicesinto distinct buckets.  With the introduction of computers into thetelephone network in the 1960s and 1970s, a new animal emerged, calleddata, which didn't fit the traditional categories.  The Commissionresponded in the Computer Inquiries by generally placing data outsidethe regulatory obligations of Title II of the Communications Act.That far-sighted decision created a new space for innovation on top ofthe regulated communications infrastructure, opening the door for theemergence of the Internet.[SLIDE 3] In time, the "data" category grew larger and more important.As all communications networks have gone digital over the past twentyyears, "data" has increasingly overlapped with traditional regulatedservices.  Which brings us to VOIP.  Is it within the unregulated dataportion of the circle, or the regulated telephony portion?  That isthe wrong way to look at the problem.[SLIDE 4] It's the wrong way to look at the problem because, in adigital world, everything is data.  The network that delivers Webpages and files can also deliver voices and moving pictures.  Voice isjust one class of application, which can be implemented in manydifferent ways.  And telephony is just one of a plethora of voiceapplications.In this world, trying to put services into buckets is a hopelessexercise. The critical issues are interconnection among networks, andopenness of platforms.  For a digital broadband world is a world oflayered networks. Competition and innovation at every layer depend onopen connectivity to other layers, from the physical infrastructurethrough devices, applications, and content.[SLIDE 5] So let's look at what's happening in the VOIP world today.VOIP is more than just services like Vonage and Skype that looksimilar from a distance to basic telephony.*	Telesym PocketPC softphone*	Webcam using VOIP for Internet videoconferencing*	Yahoo Messenger voice chat*	Vocera voice over WiFi badges*	Pocket Tunes streaming Shoutcast radio (including talk radio)*	Microsoft Xbox Live with headphones for multiplayer gaming*	Roger Wilco PC-based voice chat for gamers*	VOIP for mobile phone push-to-talk functionalityApply traditional regulatory obligations to these services would makeno sense.  In short, calling VOIP just a new form of competition fortelephone companies is like calling the automobile a fast horse.  It'ssomething fundamentally different.[SLIDE 6] Let me conclude with a few points to help shape ourdiscussion:Voice is not telephony.  Just because a service delivers voice overcommunications networks doesn't mean it should be a subject to legacyregulation.In a world of digital internetworking, applications, including voice,are defined at the edges of networks.  They can evolve outside thecontrol or even awareness of service providers and devicemanufacturers.On the Internet, a packet is a packet.  It doesn't know whether it istransmitting a chunk of a voice call, a document, or a movie.  Anylegal rule that pretends otherwise will fail.Finally, innovation happens.  The Commission must adopt rules that aretechnology neutral, because otherwise it will find itself scramblingto keep up with adaptations in equipment and services.So in conclusion, the question should not be, "What is Voice Over IP?"Instead, the Commission should be asking what is the purpose ofregulating certain forms of voice communication, and how can it adaptits rules to the sea-change now occurring as we enter a digitalbroadband world.----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERESTING LINKS FROM DECEMBER 2003http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/7495091.htmFCC Commissioner Copps' op-ed on the battle for open broadbandrtsp://video.c-span.org/fdrive/15days/e120103_fcc.rmCSPAN video of FCC voice over IP forum (Real format)http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20031216-090337-5664r.htmQwest CEO Dick Notebaert advocates unregulated voice over IPhttp://msnbc.msn.com/id/3606168/Newsweek's Steven Levy on new Internet control mechanismshttp://gigaom.com/archives/2003/12/when_vonage_goes_portable.htmlOm Malik reports on Vonage's upcoming softphone servicehttp://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862091_mz063.htmBusinessWeek on spam's threat to Internet opennesshttp://tinyurl.com/3b9reToshiba developing nickel-sized gigabyte hard driveshttp://www.toyz.org/mrblog/archives/00000103.htmlDavid Beckemeyer on voice over broadband vs. "true" VOIPhttp://ross.typepad.com/blog/2003/12/decentralizatio.htmlRoss Mayfield reports on Verisign CEO Stratton Scalvos' commentsabout recentralizing the Nethttp://tinyurl.com/y1frNova Spivak on the birth of the metawebhttp://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/08/technology/08divide.htmlICANN's failure helping efforts for governmental Internet management----------------------------------------------------------------------If you are aware of others who would like to receive the SupernovaReport, please forward this email and copy supernova@pulver.com.
