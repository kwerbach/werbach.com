          <span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Mr.
                Chairman, and Members of the Commerce Committee, thank you for
                the opportunity to testify on the implications of voice over
        Internet protocol technology. </font></o:p></span></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I am the founder of the
            Supernova Group, an independent technology analysis and consulting
            firm. Earlier in my career, I had the honor of serving as Counsel
            for New Technology Policy at the Federal Communications Commission.
            I participated in the FCC’s efforts, starting nearly a decade ago,
            to understand a phenomenon we called “Internet telephony.” </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I’m here to tell you that
            VOIP presents tremendous opportunities for the US economy and the
            American people. As my written statement explains in more detail,
            we are witnessing the most significant change in telecommunications
            since Alexander Graham Bell called out for Mr. Watson. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Historically, telephony
            and other services like broadcasting were tied to specific infrastructure
            and regulatory regimes. The service was the network. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the converged digital
            world, however, there is one network of networks, the Internet, bound
            together with common technical protocols. Instead of data as a service
            delivered through a voice-oriented telephone network, voice is becoming
            a class of applications on top of data networks. To a data network,
            a voice call is nothing more than an instant message with different
            latency and reliability characteristics. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>[Hold up Grandstream
              device]</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Consider this device. It
            may look like a phone, but it’s actually a data terminal for voice
            over broadband service. It has an Ethernet port on the back, rather
            than an RJ-11 phone jack. Should regulatory obligations depend on
            the shape of a jack?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>[Hold up Motorola ATA]</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">How about this? It doesn’t
            look like a phone at all. But it’s essentially the same device as
            the previous one, just without a keypad, microphone, or speakers.
            This is the Motorola box Vonage gave me as part of its VOIP service.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em>[Hold up laptop]</em></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now, I don’t think anyone
            here would call this a phone. But if I load a piece of software called
            a softphone client onto this laptop, and plug in a simple headset,
            it becomes a voice communications end-point. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If I then use the laptop
            to call my friends, who is the service provider that would be subject
            to regulation? The software vendor? The laptop manufacturer? My broadband
            provider? What if I’m online through a WiFi wireless hotspot in a
            Starbucks, and the softphone client is running on my handheld personal
            digital assistant? </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And it doesn’t end there.
            I can buy a $50 Webcam, and use it to engage in multi-point voice
            and video-conferencing with other computer users around the world.
            Or I can subscribe to the online services associated with Sony’s
            PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox video game consoles, and chat live
            with other players. Both applications use voice over IP. Even the
            push-to-talk services cellular operators are deploying generally
            employ VOIP.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As these examples show,
            VOIP is much more than services that may look similar to traditional
            circuit-switched voice telephony. Trying to separate out unregulated
            from regulated VOIP applications will prove to be an impossible exercise. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Engineers use the concept
            of layering to describe how data networks operate. The underlying
            physical transmission is a separate layer from higher-level functions,
            just as cars are separate from the highways they drive on.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A layered approach to communications
            regulation would distinguish among content, applications, addressing,
            and physical transmission. Open and non-discriminatory connectivity
            between those layers ensures innovation and competitive deployment
            of new applications. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In considering the policy
            concerns we’ve been asked to address, we must step back and examine
            the point of existing regulatory obligations and taxes. And then
            we must adapt our policy approaches to reflect the changes sweeping
            the industry.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The current systems of
            universal service funding and inter-carrier compensation must be
            reformed if universal service is to endure. Such reforms will only
            succeed if all parties have a reason to come to the table. It would
            be a sad irony if our attempts to impose universal service obligations
            on VOIP limited deployment of technologies that can help bring affordable
            advanced communications capabilities to all Americans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For social policy obligations
            such as law enforcement access, consumer protection, and emergency
            services, voluntary industry efforts now underway should be given
            an opportunity to succeed, before regulators and Congress should
            consider the need for targeted action. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">With VOIP, we are seeing
            the Internet realize its destiny. We can embrace that future, or
            we can try to pull the Internet back into yesterday’s regulatory
            system. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Make no mistake. Broad-brush
            regulation of VOIP is tantamount to regulation of Internet applications.
            From the network’s perspective, a stream of voice bits is no different
            from an eBay auction or a Google search. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If the US is to remain
            the leader in the information-driven global economy of the 21st century,
            we must continue our enlightened policies to favor innovation and
            competitive markets, while remaining committed to our essential social
        goals. </font></p>
