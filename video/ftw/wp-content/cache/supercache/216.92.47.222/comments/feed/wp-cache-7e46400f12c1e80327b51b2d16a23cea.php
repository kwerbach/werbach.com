I agree with you Roman. I believe it is business intelligence&#039;s job to create big data into smart data into everyday data

there should be a push into make everyone better information workers]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article. But it is also the other way round. Too often Big Data is just one thing: BIG.

And this often makes it too uncomfortable to work with it. While Gamification need big data to be able to achieve a successful context with its users it is also big data that needs the help of Gamification to make it more intuitive and understandable.

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, the best part is the impact that Big Data can have on design of Gamified systems. Where big data is just a design tool which makes sense out of humongous data, the greater challenge lies in how the insights are used to make problems more engaging and most importantly FUN to do.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Steve,

I am one of the students enrolled for your April 1 session on Coursera.

I was always on the lookout for a book that could help bring in the excitement of the world of entertainment and sports into the workplace. Upon your invitation, I promptly ordered the e book and your book responded to my prayers very well. 

I just now finished reading the 116 pages in one go (3 hours) and it was simply unputdownable.

I am looking forward to the course with great expectations and enthusiasm.

Ideally I would like to market my forthcoming book in an interactive way adopting the 6 step process outlined in Pages 66-74. I hope to work on this project alongside the six week session.

Thank you very much.]]></description>

Steve, 

Thanks for taking an interest in our book and in gamification. We think it&#039;s a great idea to gamify classrooms and likely to be an essential tool to the future of education. 

We wrote an article on the Khan Academy from founder Salman Khan. The article is available here: http://gamifyforthewin.com/2012/08/khan-academys-vision-of-the-future-of-education/ 
As you will notice, he has helped implement gamification in several classrooms. 
Info here: http://www.losaltos.k12.ca.us/District/Department/26-Academics/3671-Khan-Academy.html
And here: http://www.khanacademy.org/coach-res/case-studies/v/los-altos

We also wrote on article on a panel titled &quot;Technology in Education: How Will it Change the Game?&quot; Link to the article here (and a link to the panel): http://gamifyforthewin.com/2012/07/gaming-as-an-educational-tool/

Those should be some good places to start.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a high school principal reading this as a potential summer reading book for our teaching staff. I see a lot of possibility in learning to use gamification to improve instructional design and practice, and am wondering if you know of any people, schools, or resources I could connect to in order to help me see if this would be a worthwhile direction.

Thanks,
Steve Wallis]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As mentioned in previous comments, I don&#039;t think leveling up and earning money would fit to raise awareness on that matter. The gamer wouldn&#039;t feel cold and would leave his character sleeping outside while he has the comfort of his bed, for instance.
Game? Good.
Awareness? Bad.]]></description>
