<sup>2</sup><i>See </i>Sidney Harcave, <b>First Blood: The Russian Revolution
of 1905 </b>for an explanation of the fundamental divisions in Russian society
at this time.  For a broad overview of the revolution of 1905 in the context of
Russian history, <i>see </i>Nicholas Riazanovsky, <b>A History of Russia.</b><p>
<a name="fn1">[3]</a>I will use the term "government" to describe the Tsarist
regime, including Ministers and other officials appointed by the Tsar, but
specifically excluding the elected representatives of the Duma.  While after
1905 there were legal political parties and a parliament with legislative
powers, these were clearly distinct from and often in conflict with the Tsar
and the Ministries.  <p>

<a name="fn9">[11]</a>Count Sergei Witte was, except for Stolypin, probably
Nicholas' most competent advising.  As Minister of Finance, he spearheaded the
industrialization drive which began to transform Russia in the 1890s, and
despite Nicholas' inconsistencies managed to generate confidence in the Russian
government.  By the time of the Revolution of 1905 Witte was losing favor with
the Emperor, though he was widely respected for negotiating a successful end to
the War with Japan in the Treaty of Portsmouth.<p>

<a name="fn12">[14]</a>Te Social Democratic party included the Bolsheviks and
mensheviks, and generally represented classical Marxist ideology.  The
Socialist Revolutionaries were more populist in their orientation, focusing on
the revolutionary possibilities of the peasantry.  The Socialist
Revolutionaries also sponsored terrorist acts through their "Battle
Organization."  It is important to realize that both these (and all other)
political parties were illegal prior to the Revolution of 1905.<p>
<a name="fn13">[15]</a>Informal bands of ultra-conservative Russians, who took
it upon themselves to preserve order.  The Black Hundreds are best known for
their activities in harassing and assaulting Russian Jews, often with the tacit
or indirect support of members of the government.<p>

<a name="fn15">[17]</a>Pyotr Stolypin was one of the more interesting figures
in pre-revolutionary Russia.  A provincial governor who had been successful in
putting down revolutionary activity in the province of Saratov, he was eventual
named to the important post of Minister of the Interior and shortly thereafter
Prime Minister.  Stolypin became know for advancing significant reforms,
especially in the area of agriculture, while at the same time ruthlessly
suppressing terrorist and revolutionary activity in the countryside.  Some
today (including the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn) feel strongly that Stolypin
could have prevented the revolution of 1917 had he lived to fully implement his
programme.<p>

<a name="fn31">[33]</a>McLean, p. 391.<p>
<a name="fn32">[34]</a>McLean argues that a more accurate term would be
"illusionism," as writers attempted to create the illusion that they were
describing reality.  As he points out, realism did not imply some lack of
narrative technique, but rather required specific stylistic methods that
imitated a lack of literary conventionality and strove to create the illusion
of an unmediated representation of reality.  <p>
<a name="fn33">[35]</a>Mirsky, p. 172.<p>
<a name="fn34">[36]</a>This may appear to conflict with the belief that art was
inferior to  reality.  In fact, while the realists held that "life" was
primary, they saw art as an invaluable tool in showing people just what life
consisted of.  Art by itself could not change reality, but it could provide
people with the understanding and ability to do so.<p>
<a name="fn35">[37]</a>There were works which explicitly described a utopian
vision for social development in this period, such as Bogdanov's <b>Red Star
</b>(1908).<p>

<a name="fn39">[41]</a>The relationship between symbolism and modernism is
complex.  While symbolism can be conceived as one current within the larger
framework of modernism, some symbolists attacked modernism for what they saw as
its excessive stress on art for its own sake.  See Wladimir Weidl&eacute;, "The
Poison of Modernism" in <b>Russian Modernism</b>  <p>

<a name="fn49">[51]</a>Most common were booklets sold by peddlers known as
<i>"lyubok"</i> literature.  The Church produced religious texts in great
quantities, and some intellectuals developed popular literature to improve the
moral or educational standing of the peasantry.  See Brooks.<p>
<a name="fn50">[52]</a>Brooks, p. xiv.<p>
<a name="fn51">[53]</a>This was less applicable for Tolstoy, who wrote many
works directed at the peasantry, primarily educational and moral tracts.  After
his celebrated "conversion" in the 1880s, he publicly abandoned "high"
literature in favor of works which advance his moral teachings.  Nonetheless,
"I Cannot Be Silent" was heavily debated in intellectual and government
circles, and can be distinguished from stories he wrote solely to educate the
peasantry.<p>

<a name="fn53">[55]</a>Brooks,<b> </b>p. 337-40.  Tolstoy was one of the major

cultural values supported by the editors.<p>

Tolstoy wrote it in 1908, it was published only in highly abridged form in
several journals.  However, the full article was widely circulated both in
Russia and abroad.  Tolstoy himself was never prosecuted for writing it, but
many of his followers were imprisoned for possessing or reading it.<p>
