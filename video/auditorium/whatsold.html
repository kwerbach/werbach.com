This is the &quot;What's New&quot; page for version 1 of my home page.  It shows the

development of my pages from their origination in January 1995 up to the point at which I

started converting everything to the new version.  All the links go to the original

versions of the relevant pages; use the navigation bar at the bottom of this page to get

<p>

<li><b>August 13, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Moved older entries in the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/guestbook.html">Guestbook</a> into a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/guestbook_old.html">separate page</a>, because the original file was

getting too long.  Added a field in the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/guestbook.html#add">Guestbook

Form</a> to find out where people heard about my pages.  If you're reading this, please

fill out the form and let me know!

</ul>





<p>

<li><b>August 12, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Enhanced the layout of my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stream_new.html">stream of consciousness

thoughts page</a>,

although the new version requires Netscape Navigator 1.1 or later.  The <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stream.html">older

version</a> is still around for those using other browsers.

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>August 1, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Added a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions list</a>, because

people frequently ask me

the same questions.

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>July 13, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>The Bare Bones Guide to HTML now has a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebones/">Gateway

Page</a> at the URL that used to lead to the HTML version.  This page provides easy

access

to all the versions of the Guide.  

<li>Added some material to the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stuff.html">Page o' Stuff</a>.

</ul>





<p>

<li><b>July 6, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>My <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html">WWW Help Page</a> has been expanded to provide

more

links on several topics, including <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html#cgi">cgi scripts</a>,

<a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html#counters">access counters</a>, <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html#guestbooks">guestbooks</a>, and <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html#advertise">how to advertise your site</a>.

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>July 5, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>I have added a page that explains <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/my_pages.html">why

my pages look the way they do.</a>  This page described some of

the design decisions that went into my pages.  I plan to add some

additional material and graphics to this page shortly.

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>July 4, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>For those of you in America, happy Independence Day!

<li>For those of you in France, Quebec, and other French-speaking

parts of the world, I now have a version of the Bare Bones Guide

to HTML <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/squelette.html">translated into French</a> by

Philippe-Alexandre Gilbert.

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>June 22, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Created a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/wwwhelp.html">WWW Help Page</a> to answer

some of the questions I frequently get asked by people who read

my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebones/">Bare Bones Guide to HTML</a>.  The new

page offers links to some of the better online sources of

information on how to create Web pages.

<li>There is now a version of the Bare Bones Guide to HTML in <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebone_table.html">table format</a>, with conversion

courtesy of R. Alan Monroe.

<p>

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>May, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Not much activity this month because I got engaged, and

consequently have been dealing with the wonderful world of

wedding planning.  

<p>

</ul>







<p>

<li><b>April 30, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>My <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/biography.html">online biography</a> has been

jazzed up with graphics and some additional info.

<p>

</ul>



<p>

<li><b>April 27, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Added <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/bloopers.html">The World According to Student

Bloopers</a>, an incredibly funny story pieced together from

student errors on history exams.

<li>Began <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stuff.html">The Page o' Stuff</a>, a

collection of witty, wacky, and wonderful tidbits of information

I have come upon on the Net and elsewhere.

<p>

</ul>



<li><b>April 24, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>I just returned from a two-week vacation in California, which

explains the lack of recent activity here.  As soon as I wade

through my EMail backlog, I'll start adding new materials.

<li>I've corrected a few minor typos on the home page and the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebones/">Bare Bones Guide to HTML</a>.   <li>There

are now quite a few entries in the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/guestbook.html">guestbook</a>, many of which include links

to the signer's home page!

</ul>



<p>

<b><li>April 9, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>If you have the time and interest, you can now read my

undergraduate <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/thesis.html">thesis</a> on the

relationship of literature and society in Russia before the

Revolution.  It's about 100 pages of text, so it may take a while

to load.

<li>Added background colors to additional pages for those of you

browsing with Netscape Navigator.  I don't know that these make

things look better, but they add some visual diversity.

</ul>



<p>

<b><li>April 6, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Added an <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebones/">HTML version</a> to my Bare

Bones  Guide to HTML, with assistance from John Berkin.

<li>My list of <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/homepages.html">outstanding home

pages</a> now  has its very own page, rather than being stuck at

the bottom of my Hotlist.

<li>Added <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/eco.html">Umberto Eco's column</a> on the Mac

vs. DOS debate, and <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/bart.html">Bart Simpson's blackboard

quotes</a> to the ever-growing section of texts on my home page.

</ul>





<p>

<b><li>April 5, 1995</b>

<ul>

<li>Reorganized the home page somewhat to group related subjects

together.

<li>Added HTML versions the Progress and Freedom Foundation's <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/magna_carta.html">'Magna

Carta'</a> and the latest issue of <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/techsupport.html">Tech  Support Tales</a>, two documents

that make fascinating reading for completely different reasons.

<li>Added some new material to my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stream.html">stream of



consciousness thoughts</a>, mostly notes from the mind-expanding

Evidence Law class I  took last year in law school and some

excerpts from my journal.

</ul>



<p>

<b><li>April 3, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/guestbook.html">Guestbook</a> page with

the  comments that people have left.  You can add to it by

sending me <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/feedback.html">feedback</a>.  

     <li>Redid the navigation buttons, because I didn't like the

way  they looked.

     </ul>



<p>

<b><li>April 2, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Posted the revised <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebone.txt">Bare Bones

Guide to  HTML</a> to

Usenet, and updated the links on my page.

     </ul>





<p>

<b><li>March 31, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Did some fairly significant reorganization and cleanup

of the main home page.  I'm still working to make it look decent

on the Mosaic browser (as opposed to Netscape).

     <li>Added my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/resume.html">resume</a>, and a page of

thoughts about <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/page_design.html">what makes a good home

page.</a>

     <li>Revised the Bare Bones Guide to HTML after getting

suggestions from some folks.  Added links so you can get the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barebone.txt">original</a> and <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/barest.txt">shorter</a> versions from my page.  Next step

is to do an HTML version.

     

     </ul>

      <p>

<b><li>March 30, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added this &quot;what's new&quot; page to keep track of changes.

     <li>Started the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/stream.html">Stream of

Consciousness Page</a>, a sort of virtual diary, to which I will

add random thoughts as they come to me.

     <li>Distributed the first version of my Bare Bones Guide to

HTML on USENET.  A link to my home page will be added soon.

     </ul>



<p>

<b><li>March 28, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added a list of <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/hotlist.html#homepages">outstanding personal home pages</a>

to my hotlist by culling through several thousand pages listed on

<a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> and the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/http://web.city.ac.uk/citylive/pages.html">Who's

Who on the

Internet</a> lists.  These are good examples of what you can do

with a home page.

     </ul>



<p>

<b><li>March 27, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/help.html">Help Page</a> to describe

the functions of all the buttons.  Somewhat unnecessary at this

point, but it may become more useful later,  especially if I

change to iconic buttons. 

     </ul>





<p>

<b><li>March 22, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added the <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/map.html">Map Page</a> to give an

overview of the various pages I have linked together.

     </ul>



<p>

<b><li>March, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Added <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/help.html">button bar</a> to aid

navigation.  Although you may not find the buttons to be useful,

I think it's important to think about user interface when

designing Web pages.  Too many pages have great material but are

hard to find your way around in.  Some thoughtful comments on

this subject can be found in <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/http://www.mcs.net/~jorn/html/net/style.html">Jorn's pages

on HTML style</a>.

     <li>Redesigned the pages to take advantage of new tags

introduced in the Netcape

1.1b browser, such as backgrounds and tables.

     <li>Added a <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/feedback.html">feedback page</a> with

fill-out forms.  My service provider,

Digex, currently allows only for simple forms that Email the

results to me, but it's far better than nothing!

     </ul>



<p>

<b><li>February, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>First version of &quot;The -k- Page&quot; goes up on the

WWW  server at

Digex.  The page is now accessible to anyone on the Net, although

I haven't advertised it  anywhere so it's unlikely that any

strangers have seen it.

     <li>Added several new pages, including my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/favorites.html">favorite things</a>, my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/hotlist.html">hotlist</a>, and my <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/biography.html">biographical info</a>.

     </ul>

<p>

<b><li>January, 1995</b>

     <ul>

     <li>Created my very first Web page: The <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~werbach/homev1/whirrled.html">Whirrled</a>

Page.  Not much here as of yet, but much more will be forthcoming

as the  Whirrled project I am working on with my brother

develops.
