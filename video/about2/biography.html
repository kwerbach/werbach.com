				<td>I'm currently the editor of <a href="http://www.edventure.com/release1/release1.html"><i>Release 1.0</i></a>, a monthly report on trends in the Internet, communications, and computing worlds. <i>Release 1.0</i> is published by <a href="http://www.edventure.com/">EDventure Holdings</a>, a company led by technology industry guru Esther Dyson that also organizes the PC Forum conference. My work email address is <a href="mailto:kevin@edventure.com">kevin@edventure.com</a>.</td>

				<td colspan="2">I previously served as Counsel for New Technology Policy at the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a> in Washington, D.C. My job was to help the FCC better understand the Internet and other new communications technologies, and to develop policies that facilitated the development of the Net rather than stifling it. If you're interested in these issues, my white paper, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OPP/working_papers/oppwp29pdf.html">Digital Tornado</a>, details the implications of the Internet for telecommunications policy.
					<p>While working at the agency, I designed the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC Home Page</a> and the Web site for the FCC's Common Carrier Bureau, although both have since been taken over and modified by other FCC staff. The FCC has been one of the most active federal agencies in making information available through the Web, and it recently launched electronic filing in all major rulemaking proceedings.</td>

				<td colspan="3">I graduated in 1994 from Harvard Law School, where I served as publishing editor of the <i>Harvard Law Review</i> and Publisher of the nation's finest law school newspaper, the <i>RECORD.</i> Unlike most of my friends, I actually enjoyed law school.
					<p>I did my undergraduate work at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> At Cal, I was very active with student and city political campaigns, and graduated with a double major in Social Science and Slavic Language &amp; Literature</td>

				<td colspan="2">For several years, I did occasional freelance and volunteer work as a graphic designer and Macintosh consultant, and also as a Web developer. These days I'm not taking on any additional work because my day job and personal projects consume all my time.
					<p>Along with my brother, <a href="http://www.actnowproductions.com">Adam</a>, I've been pondering the meaning of life and cyberspace for a multi-faceted project known as <a href="http://werbach.com/whirrled/whirrled.html">Whirrled</a>. I've also been involved with various environmental groups, collecting used CDs, and fencing, and I spent a summer in Russia studying at the Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys.</p>
					<p>I have been online, in one form or another, for more than a decade; I starting off calling local bulletin boards with a screaming 300 baud modem. So it should be no shock that, in early 1995, I suddenly become inspired to throw myself into Web design (the only surprise is that this didn't happen sooner). I've been working on this site, off and on, ever since.</td>

				<td colspan="3">Like most folks I know who are members of the much-maligned &quot;Generation X&quot;, I'm not yet sure what I want to do when I grow up -- but I'll let you know as soon as I figure it out. I've got a few parameters worked out, though: I want to do something I love, and I want to change the world.
					<p>Here's a shot of my family at a recent gathering in Vermont. My wife Johanna is on the left, and next to me are my mother, my brother, and my father.<br>
