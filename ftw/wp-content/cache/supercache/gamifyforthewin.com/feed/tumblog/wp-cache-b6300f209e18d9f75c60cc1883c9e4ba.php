<p>Dan Hunter and I are excited to announce that a revised and updated edition of <a href="https://wsp.wharton.upenn.edu/book/for-the-win/">For the Win</a>, our best-selling gamification guide, will be available soon from Wharton School Press. </p>



<p>Since the book was released in 2012, it has become the standard text for practitioners and academics on the foundational principles of gamification and game thinking. A great deal has happened over the past eight years! We&#8217;ve gone through and identified important new trends related to gamification, incorporated references to some of the major academic research addressing what were previously anecdotal claims, and updated the case studies. At the same time, we&#8217;ve kept the book short and actionable. We want it to be a useful resource, not a compilation of theory.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re excited to share the new <strong>For the Win</strong> with you. Stay tuned for an announcement on this blog!</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em>*Note: This post is credited to Ankit Shah (helped lead classroom and educational gamification initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania under Prof. Werbach) for giving me the topic idea. Follow him @AnkitAShah</em></p>
<p>Looks like gamification has met yet another challenge, but this time it isn’t as simple as convincing managers that games help efficiency and productivity. With all the advocates preaching gamification to be the next biggest thing since sliced bread, there has been an overinflating of hype and expectations. Gartner has predicted that about 80% of gamified solutions will fail in reaching business objectives by 2014 due to poor design. Their <a href="http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=2251015">article</a> claims by using the Gartner <a href="http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/methodologies/hype-cycle.jsp">Hype Cycle</a> that gamification needs to figure out ways to move past “the peak of inflated expectations” so it can be on the path to mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>What is the best way to improve gamification? Aside from complementary solutions such as gaining an overall better understanding of behavioral sciences and usability in order to implement better User Experience (UX) design, <strong>the best chance gamification has at improving its results is “Big Data”. </strong>Big Data is under the umbrella of Business Intelligence and is defined by the <a href="http://www.emc.com/leadership/digital-universe/iview/big-data-2020.htm">International Data Corp.</a> as new generation &#8220;technologies and architectures, designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery and/or analysis.&#8221; The IDC expects spending on Big Data to be about $16.9 billion by 2015, an increase from the $3.2 billion spent in 2010. This increase is for good reason. Having worked in Big Data before, I have seen the potential benefits it has of analyzing large volumes of data in statistically significant ways. What this means for gamification is that B2C loyalty and B2E productivity/efficiency can help companies better understand the behaviors of customers and employees respectively. The ‘3V’ model of volume and variety combined with velocity will improve feedback to both consumers and companies—one of the core values of gamification.</p>
<p><span id="more-820"></span>In May 2011, the McKinsey Global Institute published an <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation">executive summary</a> that explains Big Data in full. In it, they mention the five broad benefits Big Data will bring forward to the exponentially increasing information that is on Internet and multimedia. Attached is an excerpt from their summary:</p>
<p>1. Big data can unlock significant value by making information transparent and usable at much higher frequency.</p>
<p>2. As organizations create and store more transactional data in digital form, they can collect more accurate and detailed performance information on everything from product inventories to sick days, and therefore expose variability and boost performance. Leading companies are using data collection and analysis to conduct controlled experiments to make better management decisions; others are using data for basic low-frequency forecasting to high-frequency “now”-casting to adjust their business levers just in time.</p>
<p>3. Big data allows ever-narrower segmentation of customers and therefore much more precisely tailored products or services.</p>
<p>4. Sophisticated analytics can substantially improve decision-making.</p>
<p>5. Big data can be used to improve the development of the next generation of products and services. For instance, manufacturers are using data obtained from sensors embedded in products to create innovative after-sales service offerings such as proactive maintenance (preventive measures that take place before a failure occurs or is even noticed).&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">a. B2E gamification solutions can rest easy from the sound of this. Being able to understand the behavior and productivity of employees will allow companies to design gamified environments that are conducive to both company and the individual employee. Who knows? It may even be possible to create individualized gamified plans so that employees can compete against themselves and collaborate with others.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">b. Transparency and feedback are two big wins for gamification as they allow companies and consumers to understand themselves and each other better with objective quantifiable data.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">c. Creating products tailored to individuals will allow for better customer support and will thus increase loyalty. Another win for gamification.</p>
<p> In short, gamification is going through a hurdle of defining what is feasible and what is ideal. Gamification’s first few wins with the creation of Foursquare, Nike+, Decode Jay-Z, and SaaS companies such as Badgeville, Bunchball, and Big Door have shown promising hope for increasing loyalty, productivity, and efficiency across many sectors of B2B, B2C, and B2E. The early increase in hype has made many companies adopt gamification in their business objectives, but it is one thing watching the NFL and another thing actually being a quarterback or wide receiver. However, Big Data is the best chance companies of all sectors have in collectively benefiting from gamification and moving the concept towards mainstream adoption.</p>
<p>As the new year of 2013 is upon us, let’s make a resolution to practice better gamification habits. Happy New Year and good luck to everyone’s personal and business objectives.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p>Gamification, game mechanics added upon behavioral mechanics, game design, however you want to talk about the “g” word, one thing is clear—we are entering a new era of gaming. Players are shifting away from zero-sum games, opting for more social gaming counterparts that include elements of collaboration, altruism, and meaning beyond the big “W” or just as big “L”. To study the behavior of gamers, we need more than just subjective accounts as to why the world is seeing a change in gamer demographics. By understanding the ebb and flow of gamer demographics, designers will be able to design better-engaging gamified apps for the digital native world.</p>
<p>Flipping the point of focus, designers need to know more than just the psyche of gamers to be able to build successful gamified solutions. Basing implementation off of science and iterative design, designers constantly refer back to academic textbooks and research publications to find new, cutting edge ideas that potentially could hook the entire world on games. The following is an example of what a designers’ cookbook of scientific ingredients used in gamification looks like today. These sciences range in focus on the end user to the designer, including topics such as anthropology to computer science.</p>
<p align="center">
<p align="center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gamification Cookbook</span></p>
<p>1. Anthropology</p>
<p>Anthropology is the study of humanity and its interaction under many different social contexts. It is important to remember that play is a natural state of learning. From play, games are created from rule-based logic. Sports are a great example of great games that have stood the test of time because they incorporate both play and game elements. Studying humanity as a whole gives us insight as to how we globally like to play and game.</p>
<p>2. Sociology</p>
<p>Sociology is the study of a society. Similar to the study of humanity except this looks at a smaller subset of people, typically specific cultures, cities, etc. Great design principles come from understanding cultural gamification. Each culture views games differently in relation to their use, so it would be important to understand a culture before designing for its members. The <a href="http://geert-hofstede.com/dimensions.html">cultural dimensions</a> provide a great place to start.</p>
<p><span id="more-814"></span>3. Psychology</p>
<p>Gamification is already a huge proponent of psychology. Psychology, the study of behavior, has made great strides to be able to explain human behavior and cognition. To be more specific, positive psychology has proven to be a great academic resource for being able to find ways to bring bliss to people’s lives.</p>
<p>4. Mathematics</p>
<p>Mathematics has no general accepted definition. For practical reasons, math is the study of numbers and functions. All of science is fueled by math in some way, shape, or form, thus it also fuels gamification.</p>
<p>5. Computer Science</p>
<p>Computer Science is the study of more scientific approaches to computation. Similar to math, computer science theory provides strong frameworks upon which user-interfaces and algorithms provide the best gamified solutions when working together.</p>
<p>6. Human Computer Interaction</p>
<p>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study, planning, and design of the interaction between humans and technology. This field is heavily rooted in interdisciplinary connections between theoretical and behavioral sciences. A great technique learned from HCI is interviewing. Interviewing is the process of learning more about a potential end-user by asking non-binary questions that require thoughtful and personable responses. This helps identify wants from needs. Another great use of HCI is human computation—the ability to solve tough problems with the use of human and computer intellects.</p>
<p>7. Biology</p>
<p>Biology is the natural science of life. The greatest combination of gamification and biology is biofeedback—technological sensors that provide feedback on the status of bodily functions. The rise in biotechnology is allowing gamification to create successful services such as <a href="http://www.re-mission.net/">Re-Mission</a>—the popular game that has shown to fight cancer effectively.</p>
<p>8. Education</p>
<p>Gamification and Education is a no-brainer. Games stem from play, and both elements are crucial to learning—education’s primary goal. Educational pedagogies should look to use gamification as a way to promote additive learning and collaboration of knowledge creation/management.  As further proof, Prof. Kevin Werbach has successfully taught a gamification course at UPenn which in the class itself is gamified. Accounts from students at UPenn claim that the class is AWESOME!</p>
<p>9. Economics</p>
<p>Economics is the study of the scarcity and allocation of resources. Economic theory coupled with the above-mentioned sciences can help create virtual currencies that could potentially solve many real world economical problems. Gamification would bring forth great interaction principles to make a virtual currency enticing enough to use as a secondary currency that could be used for digital property creation and distribution.</p>
<p><em>Please comment on the usefulness of the cookbook and if you have a cookbook of your own to share, please do!</em></p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As gamification’s practice and theory are derived from design principles such as game design thinking and user-centered design, we discover that it is an <strong>art to implement clever gamified solutions</strong>. The art places a strong focus on end users and how they interact with user interfaces. On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>gamification theory</strong> <strong>is a mass integration of multiple scientific disciplines. </strong>The science places a strong focus on designers and how they can use academic results to help determine best behavioral models. It is important to note that the art and science coexist to co-create best gamified solutions between end users and designer. <em>However, the art is only truly experienced by the end user while the science is fully understood only by the designer.</em> This discord between perspectives is what makes gamification design hard, especially when the target audience are digital natives—people who use technology as a sixth sense. Experiences need to seamlessly appear smooth and natural for people to “get hooked” on one gamified environment over another. In this two part series, we break down the art and science of gamification with the hopes to provide practical insight.</p>
<p><em>The art of gamification focuses on the core principles of identity, onboarding, scaffolding, and mastery.</em> These principles are formed around the end users’ experiences and perspectives. <strong>Identity</strong> is manifested in the form of account creation. When users are creating an account for their gamified experience, what are the ways in which data is represented to describe you? Does the application make the user feel like a unique individual or a generic one? In RPGs such as World of Warcraft, we see identity take upon the form of multiple skills, guilds, clans, and character customization (physical features, clothes, etc.). The plethora of ways a user can create a character allows people to take on their own unique identity in the World of Warcraft realm. This uniqueness aspect to identity is what keeps people addicted to a game, and also helps for the next core principle, <strong>onboarding</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-808"></span>The process of onboarding gets users to go from home plate to first base. When someone first uses an application or service, what are the key features that get someone to use it more than a few times?  This answer is too open-ended for the scope of this blog post, but some answers could include gamification elements such as engagement loops, progression loops, motivational triggers, the “impossible to fail first time” element, and various others. However, <em>the key feature is iteration.</em> Crucial to successful onboarding comes from the idea that people learn in iterations. By offering a wide range of abilities and choices at the start, users will feel overwhelmed and lose interest. Offering meaningful choices and actions for the user in small, baby steps will keep people eager for more as long as the content is great.</p>
<p><strong>Scaffolding</strong> is the process of these many iterations. Think of scaffolds as onboarding processes for different stages of a user’s experience with a service. Each stage requires new knowledge, skills, and abilities to successfully get them on the last principle, <strong>the path to mastery.</strong> Scaffolding gives users more choices, actions, abilities, and motivation to want to become a master.</p>
<p>The end user’s perspective is focused on being and meaning rather than locations and measures. The designer is focused on locations and measures so that the end user can have a natural experience with a service. The being and meaning is manifested in art, while locations and measures are brought to surface through science. Next week, we will explore how academic advances in HCI, Big Data, Anthropology, and Psychology provide the skeletal frame for gamification designers.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p>We are now at the conclusion of what I hope has been an illuminating series thus far. To recap, the Multidimensional Workforce is a three-part series emphasizing the need to redesign the B2E environment and what it means to be a corporate citizen. Generation Y is entering the workforce at an increasing rate, and it will soon be Generation Z’s turn to become the world’s leaders. In <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/2012/10/the-multidimensional-workforce-pt-1/">Part 1</a>, we covered the importance of removing the stereotypical “dirt” to discover that Generation Y is raw, untapped potential. In <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/2012/10/the-multidimensional-workforce-pt-2/">Part 2</a>, we reviewed the critically acclaimed book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 2020 Workplace</span> as supporting evidence to our newly created <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gen-Y.jpg">Multidimensional Workforce Venn diagram</a>. In this concluding post, a sample gamified solution will be presented for ways businesses can improve the workplace atmosphere.</p>
<p>As digital natives, Generation Y and future generations are just as special as (if not more than) the Silent Generation and Baby Boomer CEOs and Managing Directors. Each generation brings forward distinct pros/cons so it is up to today’s businesses to start maximizing on the positives and minimizing on the inefficiency. <em>Thankfully, gamification is a digital native’s best friend because video games have been a primary medium for information gathering and processing for the last 10-15 years.</em> Using game design principles and user-centered design thinking, Multi-generational interactions can become more productive to business objectives. Taking a look at each intersection of the Venn diagram, here are some simple implementations that would gamify your business <a href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/books/for-the-win/"><strong>for the win</strong></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">Proposed Gamified Solution</p>
<p> 1. Generations X/Y</p>
<p>People of these generations love the idea of “gamification”—game design elements coupled with user-centered design thinking. Points, badges, leaderboard, statuses, intangible elements of being/meaning, and social elements are a great starter kit to gamifying a progressive growth structure for these generations. Generation X should be more concerned with career growth and Generation Y should start with skill/roles growth. Since getting a MBA is like a quest that rewards the person a pathway to new careers upon completion, Generation Y should first improve and refine their skills before embarking on such task. Positive growth is key.</p>
<p><span id="more-802"></span> 2. Generations X/B (Similar to Y/B)</p>
<p>More focused on user-centric design, game design elements should incorporate some sort of social mentorship structure between Generations X/Y and Baby Boomers (B). For example, gamification can be used to allow (B) to award points and meaningful virtual goods to their teammates to allow for a growth in productivity and loyalty. The possibilities are endless here but the importance lies within the meaning given to these tangible virtual goods. Meaning should come in the form of autonomous feedback, access to knowledge, and acknowledgment of competence all packaged towards career growth.</p>
<p>3. Generations X/S (Similar to Y/S)</p>
<p>The Silent Generation is filled with sagacious employees—people with great advice and experience. Generations X/Y will go to them for advice. In terms of corporate citizenship, Generations X/Y should help (S) get their work done because they are more active. In turn, task management systems should allow (S) to give altruistic gifts to (X/Y) in the form of transparency, a virtual currency, and long-term goal setting advice.</p>
<p>4.  Generations S/B</p>
<p>Generations S/B should first and foremost figure out a system of checks and balances that helps facilitate the growth of Generations X/Y. As (B) and (S) are two generations giving feedback, autonomy, transparency, virtual goods, and other game elements to (X) and (Y) as a form of status of growth, each employee in (B) and (S) should play a specific role in a Generation X/Y employees’ growth. <em>These first 4 interactions completely create an organic growth model for older generations ensuring that the younger employees are becoming more productive and efficient in the workforce.</em></p>
<p>5. Generations X/B/S</p>
<p>Generations S/B are in charge of Generation X’s career growth. This includes making sure a Generation X employee has an increased influence over the business’s key objectives and vision. For example, (B/S) should give Generation X more chances to give presentations, meet with clients, and perform other important tasks as long as they are growing at an effective rate in accordance to the company’s gamified B2E environment.</p>
<p>6. Generations Y/B/S</p>
<p>Generations S/B are in charge of Generation Y’s overall skill growth. This includes making sure a Generation Y employee is growing everyday in terms of learning all the skills necessary to succeeding in every facet of the job. For example, Generations (B/S) should focus on giving constant feedback, more autonomy, and more leadership roles on projects so (Y) can increase confidence of their dynamically growing skill-set.</p>
<p>7. Generations X/Y/B (Similar to X/Y/S)</p>
<p>An organic growth model for Generations (B/S) to use gamification to ensure the growth of (X/Y) has been laid out in the preceding generational interactions. Through these three-way interactions, Generations X/Y should always ensure that they are working hard to impress Generation S/B. Gamification elements of altruism, charity, and connectedness should be maximized upon to recognize employees that are taking care of their mentors. One of the main mottos to remember is “<strong>collaborate with others, compete with self</strong>”. Every member in this three-way generational interaction should work together to ensure the company’s organic growth model is working properly. However, they should always compete against themselves to be the best employees they can be.</p>
<p>8. Generations X/Y/B/S</p>
<p>How do all four generations interact with each other? With the rise of social media, globalization, and demographics in the workforce, how does the entire company work together to deliver effective products and services? The notion of <em>corporate citizenship</em> should ring loudly in everyone’s head. Not only are you an employee of a company, but also you are that company’s citizen. Each company has a different philosophy and means of approaching business practices. As a citizen, social responsibility is not a volunteer chore, rather a necessary one. Working for the growth and success of others around you will allow for your growth to prosper. Not only will everyone achieve individual wins, the company will win as well because a high sense of citizenship creates a tight-knit workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed reading about the redesign of the corporate setting. <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gen-Y.jpg">The Multidimensional Workforce</a> is not vanishing anytime soon; it is here to stay. Tomorrow’s generation is the key to success, and businesses should focus on tapping into the youth’s raw potential. As digital natives, future generations live and work in different ways. Maximizing upon a digital native’s natural skill sets and applying them to meet key metrics, the Multidimensional Workforce will be the secret to a business’s growth.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p>Our very own, Kevin Werbach and Dan Hunter, have released their book, <em>For the Win: How Game Thinking Can Revolutionize Your Business.</em></p>
<p><em></em><em>__________ </em></p>
<p><strong>An overview:</strong></p>
<p>Take your business to the next level—<em>for the win</em>  Millions flock to their computers, consoles, mobile phones, tablets, and social networks each day to play World of Warcraft, Farmville, Scrabble, and countless other games, generating billions in sales each year. The careful and skillful construction of these games is built on decades of research into human motivation and psychology: A well-designed game goes right to the motivational heart of the human psyche.</p>
<p>In <em>For the Win,</em> authors Kevin Werbach and Dan Hunter argue persuasively that gamemakers need not be the only ones benefiting from game design. Werbach and Hunter are lawyers and World of Warcraft players who created the world’s first course on gamification at the Wharton School. In their book, they reveal how game thinking—addressing problems like a game designer—can motivate employees and customers and create engaging experiences that can transform your business.</p>
<p><strong>And Some Reviews:</strong></p>
<p>“Like gamification, this book is a fusion of human nature and good design. Far and away the best book on the subject, with the most examples and the best intellectual grasp of the topics.”</p>
<p><strong>—Bing Gordon, Partner, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers; former Chief Creative Officer, Electronic Arts</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>“If you want to understand one of the most important trends in business today, go out and buy <em>For the Win</em>. Werbach and Hunter reveal the secrets to powering up your organization through game thinking. Read this book. It&#8217;s a game changer.”</p>
<p><strong>—Brad Feld, Managing Director, Foundry Group; Co-author of <em>Do More Faster</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>“<em>For the Win</em> hits a home run in illustrating the business value of gamification for both small and large companies across the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>—Kris Duggan, CEO, Badgeville</strong></p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>To all our gamified readers, get yourself a copy. You won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://visual.merriam-webster.com/society/education/school/classroom.php"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-781" title="classroom" src="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/classroom-300x209.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></a></span>In case you have been living under a rock, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad mini</a> has made its <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/10/23/apple-ipad-mini-hands-on-video/">debut</a>. It’s smaller (obviously), more portable, and more affordable than the iPad. And while gadget nerds everywhere are comparing it to its larger predecessor and discussing internals, I was curious what this means for classrooms.</p>
<p>The mini iPad is ripe <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ipad-375515-new-apple.html">for classroom use</a> and because classes all over are embracing the more technologically advanced younger generations, it’s not unfathomable that students will soon meet Apple’s new gadget, hopefully with some gamified learning tools.</p>
<p>Gamification, by providing instantaneous feedback, competition, and rewarding for even the smallest steps of progress is exactly the kind of motivation kids need, especially with respect to learning. And aside from drawing kids in and keeping them engaged with educational tools, gamification can also help build kids&#8217; ability to be competitive and allow them to gain confidence. I wish gamified learning had been a classroom option in my younger years because I for one have always learned more productively with some sort of game (I&#8217;m thinking of the hours I spent with my <a href="http://www.teachersparadise.com/c/ac-adaptor-geosafarimathsafari-p-19587.html">GeoSafari</a>). So I hope that schools take advantage of the new methods of learning available to them.</p>
<p>And I know there are other smaller tablets on the market, but I am extremely partial to Apple (I have more Apple products than can be counted on two hands). So I am excited and hopeful that schools will use the mini iPad to gamify students’ learning experience.</p>
<p>Any predictions on some of the new ways app developers can infuse gamification into their educational applications?</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p>In <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/2012/10/the-multidimensional-workforce-pt-1/">Part 1</a> of the Multidimensional Workforce, we analyzed how Gen Y is stereotyped and why these stereotypes are actually hiding the true potential of today’s generation. Rash behavior should be channeled into ambition. Informality should be channeled into efficiency. Selfishness should be converted to a self-motivated drive. How can these transformations happen? Since companies have a <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gen-Y.jpg">multidimensional workforce</a>, how can various generational interactions mentor today’s generation to succeed in the rapidly changing professional world?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gen-Y.jpg">venn diagram</a> explains how the current work atmosphere shouldn’t just focus on accommodating future Gen Y employees. Rather, the increase of Gen Y in the workforce affects the entire demographic within a company. In the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2020-Workplace-Innovative-Companies-Tomorrows/dp/0061763276">The 2020 Workplace</a>, written by Jeanne Meister and Karie Willyerd, it vividly shows through examples and case studies that the year 2020 will be fundamentally different than today’s work culture. Three major shifts they claim are <em>globalization, demographics, </em>and <em>social web</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Globalization</strong> is seen by the fact that technology has broken down geographical barriers (ex. Airplanes and social media). Social media channel Twitter proves an example of globalization in the workplace. In 140 characters or less, you are expected to compress complex verbiage in a short, concise message. With a plethora of tweets being sent per second all around the world, Twitter has given the world a chance to communicate with each other in real time. Twitter is a great example of how business doesn’t end even though it may be nighttime in a certain area. Twitter’s ability to continue a conversation regardless of time zone gives way to fact that today’s generations love a great work/life balance. <strong>Demograhics</strong> in 2020 will shift the various generation populations in the workplace, similar to the Multidimensional Workforce. By 2020, Jeanne and Karie believe Gen Z will take up 7% of the entire company atmosphere, Gen X/Y 50%, Baby Boomers 22%, and Silent Generation 1%. Lastly, the <strong>Social Web</strong> refers to the upcoming collaboration revolution. With various blogs, wikis, and content management systems, knowledge sharing and collaboration is the future.</p>
<p><span id="more-771"></span>From <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 2020 Workplace</span>, what insight is created? There are two things that clearly underlie a powerful message about current and future generations. First, future works entering a workplace value feedback coupled with speed and autonomy of knowledge gathering, creation, and sharing. Second, future generations are blank slates. In a <a href="http://weplay.co/gamification-envisioning-a-new-tomorrow/">related post</a> on Generation Y, we should realize that today’s and tomorrow’s generations are living in a world that is constantly throwing informational and sensory stimuli at them in a rapidly increasing rate. As digital natives, our attention span and focus is placed less on remembering these stimuli and more on acting upon them. This has carried over to the educational and learning pedagogies of today’s generation</p>
<p><em>Today’s generations are blank slates.</em></p>
<p>As digital natives living in a world with massive amounts of information, we have learned how to use technology as a crutch to help us gather, process, and act upon insights derived from raw information. Although many amazing things are happening, we need to be mindful of designing to convert blank slates into productive employees. This design calls for gamification.</p>
<p>I was supposed to cover the gamification aspects of the Multidimensional Workforce Venn diagram in Part 2. However, I recently read <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 2020 Workplace</span> and felt is was necessary to relate it to the Multidimensional Workforce<em>. </em>I encourage everyone to read the book as it provides an illuminating view on how serious of a topic this is. <em>As every second passes, businesses need to stress the importance of reassessing the philosophy of corporate citizenship because a new generation is getting ready to trade textbooks, student loans, and exams in college for feedback, autonomy, and mentorship in the professional world.</em></p>
<p>In the third and final part of the Multidimensional Workforce, we will examine what exactly does it mean to be a corporate citizen. On top of that, we will discover clever gamification techniques to help create a tight-knit working community that will succeed in tomorrow’s markets</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p><a href="http://lastpickproductions.com/ibeg/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-761" title="Untitled" src="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Untitled-300x151.png" alt="" width="300" height="151" /></a>I have lived in New York City for just over two years now and I am ashamed to admit that the homeless faces that frequent the subways, sidewalks, and parks now make less of an impression on me. Maybe the modus operandi for a New Yorker requires this sort of numbing to homelessness or just the fact that New York City seems to be, at times, overrun with the problem. Whatever the case may be, my wide-eyed eagerness to help whenever I could has faded.</p>
<p><a href="http://lastpickproductions.com">Last Pick Productions</a>, a Vancouver videogame studio, has created an application to (hopefully) help remedy this problem. The app, called <a href="http://lastpickproductions.com/ibeg/">iBeg</a>, is expected to release in the spring of 2013 and is meant to simulate the life of a homeless person. A player is given a homeless avatar and is charged with the responsibility of keeping that avatar fed, clean, and protecting it against the harsh elements that come with living on the street. There are a few different options a player can choose so that their homeless avatar can earn money: simply beg pedestrians, play an instrument, or create a story like you just need money to fix your car.</p>
<p><span id="more-760"></span></p>
<p>As you become more accustomed to life on the street and start making wiser choices, your avatar will be given the opportunity to level up their street smarts in order to become more proficient. And the money that is earned from odd jobs can be used to unlock more content within the game.</p>
<p>But Last Pick Productions wasn’t just trying to allow a user to feel, even if it’s in the comfort of their own home and just through a virtual world, what it might be like to be homeless. There was also a desire to create a real-world impact by directing a portion of the money users spend on in-game purchases to charities.</p>
<p>On paper, iBeg seems like a fantastic concept. They always say that you can’t really know a person until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. And while the shoes in this instance are virtual, perhaps this game can raise awareness about what it’s like to be homeless and the donated portions can really make a difference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, is homelessness really something that should be gamified? I’m not so sure. I doubt a homeless person would take me seriously if I said I was trying to know what he or she feels like by way of a virtual world on my iPad. You can’t really know how it feels to sleep outside in NYC in January unless you’ve done it, right? What do you think, good or bad idea?</p>

						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Posted in <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/category/gamification/" rel="category tag">Gamification</a></p><p style="text-align: left;" align="center">As we continue to enter to a new technological age, we are faced with many different challenges. Although it may not get as much attention in the media because it is a tough puzzle to solve, businesses have to focus on solving their approach to the multidimensional workforce.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">The multidimensional workforce welcomes the addition of Gen Y and already consists of the Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, and Gen X. Unfortunately, there is discord between generations because Gen Y workers come off as being rash, informal, and selfish. Few companies are starting to rub off the “stereotypical” dirt to uncover the fact that Gen Y is actually <strong>ambitious, efficient</strong>, and <strong>self-driven</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="text-align: center;">Who is Gen Y? No exact years are given, but those born in between 1979-1997 are considered to be a part of Gen Y. Gen Y embodies the love and sense of entitlement they received from their Baby Boomer parents who worked hard to give the best to their children. Below is a complete profile of Gen Y:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Values: meritocracy, camaraderie, non-traditionalism, work-life balance, self-expression and meaning</li>
<li>Self-Perception: unique, proud, confident, entitled, frustrated, impatient</li>
<li>Skills: technology-related tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Gen Y believes that the strongest survive. Valuing meritocracy, good work should be rewarded properly. A sense of teamwork for collaboration or competition and flexibility in work procedures are sought after in this generation. The normal 9-5 schedule doesn’t work, as there should be a great work/life balance. Strongly results driven, people of this generation want to see life move in double time. They can’t wait to be at the top of the ladder and will work hard to find ways to be recognized. As the work-life perception is more balance, the work will get done, doesn’t matter what time it gets done. With the immersion in the Internet and amount of information, people are able to express themselves in ways that are very unique. Social media has given this generation a new way to express who they are, what they like, and so forth. Gen Y is proud of this and highly values self-expression.</p>
<p>Most of Gen Y was given constant positive feedback from parents, and therefore have a high level of confidence. It may come off as arrogance, but the multidimensional workforce should recognize that this “arrogance” is actually a strong level of confidence and ambition. Although Gen Y is not typically loyal to the company, they are loyal to their work. <em>The rise of social responsibility and technology has given the majority of Gen Y to participate in meaningful work. This work is defined uniquely for each employee, and this is the key to tapping Gen Y’s potential.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-714"></span>By 2020, the US Bureau of Labor predicted that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-why-companies-should-give-millennial-workers-everything-they-ask-for-2012-8">Gen Y</a> will make up 40% of the workforce. Whether or not businesses like it, Gen Y is here to rule the world. Businesses have to start designing for the future of employment, so it is advantageous to employ people who understand customers the best—other Gen Y’ers. Luckily, Gen Y is motivated by meaningful work, constant feedback, self-expression, competition, altruism, and teamwork. If you have been following Prof. Kevin Werbach’s gamification lectures on Coursera, it is quite obvious that gamification can help solve the problem of integrating Gen Y into the workforce. In Bunchball’s white paper “<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/idegasperi/bunchball-gamification-at-work">Gamification at Work”,</a> they cited a 2011 MTV study saying Gen Y’s universal quote was #winning. Games have been a part of their digital media, and much learning goes on in game environments. Gen Y speaks the language of games, and businesses should start to speak the same.</p>
<p>Remember, Gen Y is not a nuisance. They are untapped potential. Mentorship and guidance will help Gen Y employees discover what is meaningful to them while driving innovation and growth for your company. There is a clear win-win if businesses are willing to welcome Gen Y. There is no reason not to. I’m 20, and I recently got inducted into the Gamification Guru <a href="http://gamificationofwork.com/2012/10/gamification-gurus-october-2012/">leaderboard</a>. I like to say my ambition knows no bounds, but I am frustrated because I am a college student confused about the future. I’m not sure if I will get a job after I graduate, and I am very focused on school. When I enter the workforce, I may not understand the corporate culture principle or corporate etiquette, but my generation is a quick study. We learned how to process massive amounts of information quickly from spending our second lives on the Internet. We just need mentorship and guidance for onboarding. Gen Y loves the path to mastery, and businesses will love their investment in this emerging workforce.</p>
<p>To get a better picture of the workplace, this <a href="http://gamifyforthewin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Gen-Y.jpg">Gen Y Venn Diagram</a> explains the interactions that go on in the multidimensional workforce. These insights provide key features of each generation while showing areas of interest in different generation interactions. For the next post in my Gen Y series, I will focus on each of these interactions and explain how gamification can best maximize productivity and engagement in inter- and intra- generation communication.</p>
