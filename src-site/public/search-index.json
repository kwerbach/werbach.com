Blockchain offers an alternative model based on cryptographic verification and distributed consensus.\n\nNew Models of Trust\n\nThe blockchain era introduces several new trust models:\n\n1. Cryptographic verification replacing institutional guarantees\n2. Transparent transaction histories enabling auditability\n3. Decentralized governance distributing control\n\nImplications and Challenges\n\nWhile blockchain offers promising new approaches to trust, significant challenges remain in terms of scalability, governance, and real-world adoption.",
