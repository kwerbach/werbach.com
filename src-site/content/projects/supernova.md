## Overview

From 2002 to 2010, I hosted the Supernova executive technology conference, which anticipated critical developments on the path to the Network Age. Supernova brought together CEOs, entrepreneurs, technologists, thinkers and other leaders in the developing internet economy.

&nbsp;

## The Vision

Supernova was more than a conference—it was a gathering place for the people and ideas shaping the future of technology and business. At a time when the internet was still finding its footing after the dot-com crash, Supernova provided a forum for deep thinking about how networks would transform industries, create new business models, and reshape society.

&nbsp;

## Key Themes

Throughout its decade-long run, Supernova explored themes that would become central to the digital economy:

- The emergence of social networks and user-generated content
- Platform business models and network effects
- The tension between innovation and regulation
- Privacy and data governance
- The transformation of traditional industries through connectivity
- The shift from closed systems to open ecosystems

## Impact and Legacy

Supernova sessions featured conversations with industry pioneers, policy leaders, and academic researchers who were grappling with the implications of the networked world. The conference helped frame many of the debates that continue to shape technology policy and business strategy today.

The insights and relationships developed through Supernova informed my subsequent work on emerging technologies, from blockchain and digital assets to AI governance and platform regulation.
