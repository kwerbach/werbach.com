## Abstract

Smart contracts—self-executing agreements written in computer code and deployed on blockchain platforms—promise to revolutionize how parties create and enforce contractual obligations. By automatically executing agreed-upon terms when specified conditions are met, smart contracts can reduce transaction costs, eliminate intermediaries, and create new forms of economic coordination. However, they also raise profound questions about the nature of contract law and the role of legal institutions in commercial relationships.

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of smart contracts from both technical and legal perspectives. It examines three core aspects: (1) **How smart contracts work** - the technical architecture enabling automated execution on distributed ledgers; (2) **What makes them "smart"** - the specific capabilities that distinguish them from traditional contracts and digital automation; and (3) **What makes them "contracts"** - whether and how they fit within existing contract law frameworks.

The analysis reveals fundamental tensions between smart contracts' technical operation and traditional legal concepts. Smart contracts are simultaneously more rigid (unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances) and more flexible (programmable to handle complex contingencies) than conventional agreements. They operate with mathematical precision but struggle with ambiguity, context-dependence, and the equitable considerations that permeate contract law.

Through examination of actual smart contract platforms (particularly Ethereum), the paper identifies four critical challenges: (1) **The Oracle Problem** - how smart contracts obtain reliable real-world information; (2) **The Completeness Problem** - whether contracts can be fully specified in code; (3) **The Governance Problem** - how to resolve disputes and adapt agreements over time; and (4) **The Compatibility Problem** - integrating smart contracts with existing legal systems.

The paper argues that smart contracts represent not a replacement for traditional contract law, but rather a complementary tool that works best when integrated with legal frameworks. The analysis develops a taxonomy of smart contract types and proposes principles for their legal treatment, offering guidance for courts, legislatures, and practitioners navigating this emerging technology.
