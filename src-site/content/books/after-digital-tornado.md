## About the Book

**After the Digital Tornado: Networks, Algorithms, Humanity** is a comprehensive examination of how networks powered by algorithms are transforming society. The internet once seemed an unambiguous benefit to society. Today it's the basis for invasions of privacy, massive concentrations of power, and wide-scale manipulation.

This collection commemorating the 20th anniversary of Kevin Werbach's influential Federal Communications Commission whitepaper on internet policy brings together leading scholars to explain how we got here, and how to move forward. The algorithmic networked world poses deep questions about power, freedom, fairness, and human agency.
