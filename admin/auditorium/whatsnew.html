                        <ul>
                                <p>I've moved this site to a new Web hosting provider, Pair Networks.
</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 2, 2000</b></p>
			<ul>
				<p>I've started redesigning the site and gradually adding new content. The new <a href="../home.html">home page</a> is already online, along with the <a href="../photos.html">photo gallery</a>. Look for more frequent updated here in the next few weeks!</p>
				<p>Several outside submissions have been added to the <a href="../stuff/smelt.html">He Who Smelt It</a> page!</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>1997-1999</b></p>
			<ul>
				<p><i>OK, OK, so I didn't update this page. But I did add material to the site, including a couple total revisions of the <a href="../barebones/">Bare Bones Guide to HTML</a>.</i></p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>May 4, 1997</b></p>
			<ul>
				<p>Added the <a href="../web/htmlfaq.html">HTML FAQ</a> to answer frequently-asked questions about HTML and Web page design. Unfortunately, I simply don't have time any more to answer individual questions that people email to me.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>April 13, 1997</b></p>
			<ul>
				Added a link to my FCC Working Paper, &quot;<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OPP/working_papers/oppwp29pdf.html">Digital Tornado: The Internet and Telecommunications Policy</a>&quot;. The paper is the first comprehensive overview of the implications of the Internet for the communications industry and the FCC.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 12, 1997</b></p>
			<ul>
				Updated my <a href="../about/biography.html">bio page</a>, and added a photo of me. Some other scanned photos are also available through the &quot;About Me&quot; section of my <a href="../home.html">home page</a>.
				<p>Put my recent <a href="../fcc/iworld.html">presentation</a> on the Internet and Telecommunications Policy online. This was delivered at the Fall Internet World 1996 conference in New York City.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>August 21, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Rearranged the home page to replace the &quot;Other Stuff&quot; section with a separate section for <a href="../whirrled/">Whirrled</a>. I did this for two reasons: to give the new and improved Whirrled materials more exposure, and to avoid any possibility of infringing on other people's copyrights. Although the recycled material in the &quot;Other Stuff&quot; section was amusing, I think it's most important to focus on the original content on this site, and Whirrled is an important part of that.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>August 20, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Added new material to the <a href="../whirrled/whirrled.html">Whirrled</a> pages, including a new <a href="../whirrled/">gateway page</a>.
				<p>Put a humorous essay about why <a href="../other/curiosity.html">English is a crazy language</a> into the <a href="../other/other.html">other stuff</a> section.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>August 16, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Added a page about my brother <a href="../adam/adam.html">Adam</a>, who is the President of the Sierra Club.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>August 15, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Some minor updates to the <a href="faq.html">FAQ page</a> and <a href="../about/biography.html">bio page</a>, which were getting a bit long in the tooth. Also, added confirmation pages for all the fill-out forms on my site.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>August 13, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Added several awards to my <a href="../awards.html">awards page</a>. Many of these happened a while ago but I either didn't know about them or didn't have time to update the page.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>July, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				I've spent most of my time this month updating the <a href="../barebones/">Bare Bones Guide to HTML</a> to version 3.0. The Guide now includes all the tags in the new HTML 3.2 specification, as well as new tags introduced with Netscape Navigator 3.0!
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>June 30, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Updated my <a href="../hotlist.html">hotlist</a> by adding many new sites, pruning others, and reorganizing things a bit.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>May, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				I haven't had much time to work on my pages because I've been too busy in my new job coordinating Internet policy issues for the FCC.
				<p>My brother Adam, at age 23, got elected president of the Sierra Club!</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>April, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Revised the <a href="../web/wwwhelp.html">WWW Help Page</a>. Added some links, removed some others, and did a minor redesign to make the page more attractive.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>March 23, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Removed several outdated links and added some new entries to the <a href="../lists/homepage_hall.html">Home Page Hall of Fame</a>.
				<p>If you're wondering why I haven't added much to my site the past month, one reason is that I was busy redesigning the Web site of my employer, the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications Commission</a>.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>February 4, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Moved everything to the <a href="http://werbach.com/">werbach.com</a> server, and installed new imagemap, counter, and form processing scripts. A mirror of these pages is still available on the <a href="http://werbach.com/mirror/">Digital Express server</a>, but the pages on the old server will not be updated, so please update your links. Now that I have access to CGI scripts and additional disk space, look out for lots of new additions in the near future!
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 15, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Spruced up the graphics on the main home page, and added header graphics to the top-level pages of each the six sections. Improved the appearance of a few of the pages, including <a href="web/page_design.html">What Makes a Good Home Page</a>, and added more of <a href="../other/bart.html">Bart Simpson's blackboard quotations</a>. I also moved the <a href="../lists/homepage_hall.html">Home Page Hall of Fame</a> from the Lists section to the Web section, where I think it fits in better.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 9, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Added some graphics to significantly improve the appearance of the <a href="../lists/homepage_hall.html">Home Page Hall of Fame</a>, and added a new page or two to the list. Also enhanced the appearance of the <a href="../barebones/">Bare Bones Guide to HTML</a> main page, and cleaned up several other things here and there. Finally, I completely redesigned the <a href="../index.html">index page</a> as a gateway to the major sections of this site.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 5, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				The <a href="../whirrled/whirrled.html">Whirrled</a> page has been significantly revised, and I have added several more pages of material from the forthcoming <i>Whirrled: A Survival Guide for the 21st Century</i>.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 4, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				I have revised the <a href="../lists/homepage_hall.html">Home Page Hall of Fame</a>, my list of outstanding home pages, to weed out some stale links and pages that no longer make the cut. The page now includes the first official Home Page Hall of Fame graphic, so people that get listed can proudly display it on their pages.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 3, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				I have added a list of <a href="../homepages.html">home pages</a> of people who have visited this site. This page will include all home pages that people submit, in contrast to my selective list of &quot;Outstanding Home Pages,&quot; which has been renamed as the <a href="../lists/homepage_hall.html">Home Page Hall of Fame</a>.
			</ul>
			<p><img src="../images/bullet2.gif" hspace="3"><b>January 1, 1996</b></p>
			<ul>
				Everything is new! The -k- Page has been totally restructured and renovated, with new pages, design, and organization. Version 2 is now open for your viewing pleasure.
