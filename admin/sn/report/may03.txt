Appleintroduced its iTunes music service, which is really more interestingfor what it says about Apple than what it means for digital musicdistribution. Dell announced it is changing its name to remove theword "computer". And articles by Steve Lohr in the New York Times (seelinks below) and Ludwig Siegele in the economist postulated thattechnology has become a mature industry, with far-reachingconsequences.The common theme is that the ecosystems of the personal computer andenterprise IT are giving way to something new. Or several new things.What comes after the PC isn't the Internet appliance, or theinteractive TV, or the smart phone -- it's all those things and more.The underlying forces are irresistible. Moore's Law continuesunabated, but for end-users today's processors don't feel that muchfaster than last year's. The market is no longer about putting a PC oneveryone's desk, or about connecting that PC to the Net, or aboutwiring up corporate systems, or about giving people tools like emailand Web browsers. Been there, done that.Smart companies like Dell, Microsoft, and Intel that have generatedextraordinary wealth by riding the PC adoption curve realize that theground is shifting. Dell's name change reflects the fact that it, likethe others, is branching out to non-PC devices. But that's the leastinteresting of the three stories this week. New platforms such ashandhelds, game consoles, and home media servers have been around forseveral years.Apple's iTunes service is more significant. Simply put, Apple isbecoming a post-PC company. Everyone scratching their heads about howthis will sell more Macs is missing the point. The Mac is near anddear to Apple, but the company has shown several times that it canjettison a core product -- the Apple II, the 68000 processor, the pre-OS X system software -- and reinvent itself. Apple is becomingsomething much closer to Sony: an integrated digital media company.Sony sells computers, but no one would call Sony a PC company. What itdoes best is create unique platforms and experiences, then market thehell out of them. That describes the new Apple as well. The heart ofthe company is the digital lifestyle, not a box. (I wouldn't besurprised if Sony acquires Apple, though similar deals have fallenthrough before.)And then there's the New York Times piece. Don't be mislead by thearticle's rhetoric about tech's "midlife crisis." That's the negativespin the Times' editors no doubt insisted on, because after all, howcould anyone say positive things about tech these days? The point ofthe article is not that tech is dying, or that innovation is dryingup. It's that enterprise technology is moving into a new phase.Bigger, faster, and more feature-laden are no longer selling points inthe same way. Smarter, simpler, more efficient, and more flexible arethe new criteria. It's much harder to make powerful system simple thanto make them complex.The same issue arises in the consumer market. Apple has won plauditsfor the user experience of its digital music service. That, more thana novel business model or better deal with the record companies, iswhat could change the market. EMusic had most of the same featureswell before iTunes. But there were personal computers before the AppleII, and graphical user interfaces before the Macintosh. Apple,especially under Steve Jobs, has a genius for user experience andpromotion. In a post-PC or post-technology world, those are twoessential skills.So, onward we go. This is a time of reinvention, not senescence, forthe tech industry.----------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERNOVA 2003July 8-9, Washington, DC area<http://www.pulver.com/supernova/>Supernova brings together cutting-edge executives and companies toconsider the distributed future of communications, software, andmedia. It is the one place that assembles the people, companies,investors, and trends that will lead the next wave of technology-driven change.Our insightful and provocative speakers include former FCC ChairmanReed Hundt, Sun Microsystems EVP Jonathan Schwartz, Nokia's MarkoAhtisaari, Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, Neoteny CEO Joichi Ito,Macromedia's Kevin Lynch, Assistant Secretary of Commerce BruceMehlman, and commentator Clay Shirky.Sign up now for the only conference focused on the businessimplications of decentralizing technologies such as WiFi, Webservices, connected digital devices, weblogs, and broadband media!Visit <http://www.pulver.com/supernova> for more information.----------------------------------------------------------------------COMMUNICATIONSWhere the Money IsCapital spending by large telecom incumbents like SBC and AT&Tcontinues to go down. Analysts take this as evidence that the hoped-for rebound in the telecom sector hasn't yet materialized. This is amisleading way to evaluate the market. It's the same mistake the musicindustry makes in using CD sales trends to show the threat from onlinefile-sharing. The part is substituting for the whole.There are several telecom businesses. There is the telecom industrythat actually delivers stuff to users, which further divides intothose who deliver bits, and those who deliver atoms. And then there isthe industry that delivers stuff to other telecom companies, againdivided into bits and atoms. The spending numbers you're hearing arefor the last of these categories: companies selling infrastructureequipment to service providers. Meanwhile, the business of sellingdevices to end-users, especially WiFi gear, is booming. Why else wouldCisco spend $500 million to acquire Linksys?  And just wait until theVOIP phone market (another Cisco area of emphasis) really begins toscale.In a slow-growth, infrastructure-heavy market, capital spending onnetwork equipment is a good proxy for the industry. In the innovative,fast-growth, technology-dominated industry telecom is becoming, it'snot. That will strand vendors who depend on selling lots of expensivegear, but it will also create new opportunities for companies that hadno place in the existing ecosystem. Smart vendors like Cisco havealready shifted from trying hard to play in the old sandbox topositioning themselves to serve the new markets when they develop.Telecom today isn't just traditional phone companies, any more thaninterstate transportation today is just railroads. Companies in thesector may not realize that, but outside observers should.In a similar vein, I often encounter skepticism from investors andexecutives who don't see the business model for WiFi, or otherdecentralizing developments such as Weblogs. They look at the well-publicized pure-plays such as Boingo and Cometa for WiFi, and don'tsee a path to large revenue streams and profit margins. News flash:Boingo isn't all of WiFi, any more than Netscape was all of the Web.We're past the era where startups function as proxies for an entiremarket (see, e.g., MP3.com). Every company, or at least every smartcompany, will make use of WiFi in its own way.For example, Verizon just announced it was deploying WiFi connectionsin 150 Manhattan payphones, growing to 1,000 this year. Why would alocal phone company, not known for wild spending on unproven newbusinesses, make such a move? Because Verizon is convinced that userssee value in WiFi, and it has unique assets through which to meet thatdemand. The money it earns may be purely from subscribers who *don't*abandon Verizon's DSL service for competing cable modem offerings. Therevenues look the same on the bottom line.I'm not convinced Verizon's plan will work, but I give the companycredit for trying. Meanwhile, startups such as Telesym and Vocera areusing the same WiFi technology to realize Verizon's greatest fear:free voice communications. Voice over WiFi will initially find a homein niches such as industrial and medical markets, but it has plenty ofroom to grow from there.Technological trends always create the context, and smartbusinesspeople seize on those opportunities and make use of them.Today's telecom industry faces a world where connectivity isincreasingly pervasive and increasingly cheap, but not yet uniform orubiquitous. The survivors will be those who can turn that environmentto their advantage.----------------------------------------------------------------------MEDIAThe QuickeningThe recent court decision rejecting the music industry's copyrightinfringement lawsuit against Grokster and Streamcast/Morpheus marksthe transition to the next phase of the digital content battle. It'snot the end. Certain content owners will continue to use every meansat their disposal to slow the development of digital contentdistribution. They are suing VCs, suing end-users, and, mostimportant, continuing to withhold content and demand that licensedservices impose significant restrictions. They will appeal thisdecision, and might win. Though by that time, it will be too late.It's not that hard to figure out what users want from digital music,and it wouldn't be hard to get there technically. What's missing isagreement on the business terms. Legalizing Morpheus and Groksterratchets up the pressure to resolve that dispute. That's the key.Music company executives are not irrational. So far, the costs offighting a rear-guard action have been far less than the perceivedcosts of opening the floodgates. The strategic thinkers in the contentindustries have a logical strategy: delay the onset of widespreaddigital distribution until platforms are in place to control it. Thatmeans shifting from general-purpose PCs to things like home mediaservers and handheld players with built-in digital rights management.If the Streamcast decision sticks, it will be that much harder tocross the bridge to controlled platforms.Now the spotlight turns to the licensed services, which are graduallybecoming less restrictive and including more content. Two significantdevelopments here: RealNetworks acquiring Listen.com, and Appleintroducing its digital music offering. Both are causes for hope.So we come to a fork in the road. The content industries will try touse the Streamcast decision to convince legislators that theapocalypse is nigh. They will say this shows the need for even moredraconian copyright protections and penalties. Meanwhile, reformerswithin those industries and entrepreneurs outside will argue for adifferent course. They will urge a redoubling of efforts to buildlicensed music services that generate significant revenues, becausePlan A is failing.----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERESTING LINKS FROM APRIL/MAY 2003http://tinyurl.com/c5n6New York Times article, "A New Technology, Now That New Is Old"(fee required to purchase from archives)http://www.economist.com/surveys/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1747329Economist magazine's IT industry surveyhttp://boingboing.net/2003_05_01_archive.html#200291511EFF summary of comments on FCC broadcast spectrum underlay proposal.http://www.linkedin.comLinkedIn, a new business networking service from former PayPal execReid Hoffmanhttp://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/05/07/linkedin_launches.htmlDiscussion about LinkedIn and social software on Joi Ito's site.http://publicinternetproject.org/research/moremaps.htmlNew Manhattan WiFi maps from the Public Internet Projecthttp://www.cellular-news.com/story/8773.shtmlWireless users now spend more minutes on their mobile phones thantheir landlines.http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,1043616,00.aspVoice over WiFi market plows ahead.----------------------------------------------------------------------If you are aware of others who would like to receive the SupernovaReport, please forward this email and copy supernova@pulver.com.
