First, Jeff Pulver and I will be speaking at the FCC'sVoice Over IP Forum on December 1.  This will be an important eventfor the future of VOIP and the Internet generally, since regulatorydecisions could have significant impacts on the pace of innovationand competition.  I encourage you to attend or listen to the audiostream that will be available through <http://www.fcc.gov>.  The FCCplans to start a VOIP proceeding in the next few months.Second, the New America Foundation and Public Knowledge are holding aconference on December 4 entitled "Shared Airwaves, Shared Content"<http://www.newamerica.net/index.cfm?pg=Events&AllOf=>.  They will bereleasing a spectrum policy paper I've written called "RadioRevolution," and discussing the implications of unlicensed wireless.George Gilder will give the keynote.  And to those of you in the US, best wishes for Thanksgiving!-k-Kevin Werbach----------------------------------------------------------------------In this Issue:- TELECOM: Two Cheers for More Unlicensed Spectrum- TELECOM: The Death of Telecom as We Know It- SOFTWARE: Google Constellation?- MEDIA: A Turning Point in the Digital Content War- LINKS OF THE MONTH----------------------------------------------------------------------TELECOMTwo Cheers for More Unlicensed SpectrumAs expected, the FCC approved an additional 255 MHz of spectrum thismonth in the 5 GHz range for unlicensed wireless devices.  This wasthe result of a deal several months ago between major technologycompanies and the military, which uses the spectrum for some of itsradar systems.The additional spectrum is very welcome.  It's a credit to MichaelPowell that he has taken concrete steps to facilitate the growth ofunlicensed wireless networks, with his support of WiFi, ultra-wideband, and now this step.However, there are two elements of the FCC's action that aretroubling.  The first is that the technical standards for the bandwere determined through a private negotiation.  A compromise with themilitary was necessary to free up the spectrum, and it was anaccomplishment to get any agreement at all.  However, because a fewlarge companies essentially represented the private sector in thenegotiations, it's not clear whether the standards adopted will allowfor development of innovative new services.  "Open spectrum" advocatessuch as David Reed have expressed serious reservations that the FCC'slimitations will hamstring the new band.The second concern is that this allocation will be seen as sufficientfor the full potential of unlicensed to be realized, especially last-mile broadband.  Even without the FCC technical limitations, it'simportant to note that this is high-frequency spectrum.  Radio wavesat 5 GHz don't propagate long distances or penetrate obstacles well.The new bandwidth will improve capacity for 802.11a wireless LANs, butit may not be effective for the longer-range scenarios that broadbandto the home entails.So let's congratulate the FCC for what it's done, but not pretendthey've done everything they should.  The battle for open spectrumcontinues!----------------------------------------------------------------------S U P E R N O V A   2 0 0 4June 2004San Francisco Bay Areahttp://www.pulver.com/supernova/Look for more details soon.

Inthe first camp, the most thoughtful advocate is Eli Noam of ColumbiaUniversity.  The argument is that telecom is locked in a deflationarydeath spiral, which only the stabilizing influence of regulators andoligopolies can avert.  Conventional wisdom puts FCC Chairman MichaelPowell in this camp, but I think he's a believer in the otherperspective, where I generally find myself.The alternative argument is that the death of the telecom industry aswe know it is inevitable, and efforts to pull it out of the tailspinwill only prolong and increase the pain.  Ten years ago, there was a$200 billion annual service business in the US based primarily oncharging usage fees for voice communications.  That's going away.Something else may replace it, but it will be a data internetworkingindustry with voice as one lucrative application.  The more we spendour energy pulling back from the brink, the less we focus on definingwhat will come out the other side.  And the less we think theunthinkable and work on making the inevitably painful transition lesspainful.  That's what's at stake in the upcoming FCC voice over IPproceeding, among other places.The FCC's decision to require local number portability between wiredand wireless phones by November 24 could accelerate the traditionaltelecom industry's death spiral.  According to the New York Times:	"Industry analysts estimate that 3 percent to 7 percent of	telephone users - or 4.5 million to 10.5 million people - no	longer have traditional land-line phones and rely on cellphone	services exclusively. As many as 15 percent of mobile phone	users said they would consider abandoning their traditional	phone service and moving to exclusively mobile service,	according to a survey taken last spring by the Yankee Group, a	market research firm."If 15% of customers really do turn off their landline phone service inthe next few years, the impact on the local exchange carriers would bedramatic.  Back of the envelope numbers:    * 15% of 150 million US wireless subscribers = 22.5 million      customers switching.    * Assume an average residential phone bill of $20/month, or      $240/year.    * That's $5.4 billion in annual revenue the Bells would lose.$5.4 billion is a big number.  And it might be a seriousunderstatement, because those most likely to switch are the mostactive customers, who buy the extremely high-margin value-addedservices like voicemail and caller ID.  When all's said and done, thelocal telcos could be looking at a $10 billion revenue hit, targetedat their most profitable offerings.And that doesn't even include voice over IP (VOIP).When it comes to VOIP, most of the excitement today is about consumerservices like Vonage and Skype.  Though these are indeed exciting,their impact on the industry will be limited.  The real disruptivedevelopment in VOIP is the proliferation of two standards: SIP andENUM.SIP (session initiation protocol) and ENUM (electronic numbering) arebridges between the world of telephony and the world of the Internet.They operate in the arcane world of network addressing and signaling,but smart observers are starting to recognize their significance.Voice over IP has been around commercially for at least eight years,but it's now reaching a critical stage of maturity.  Deep integrationbetween the data world and the established public switched telephonenetwork is a profound shift.  It's the difference between making aphone call over the Internet, and voice as an internetworkingapplication.  Or to put it another way, the difference between theInternet as a subset of telecommunications, and telecommunications asa subset of the Internet.  We should be focused on building thatworld, rather than trying to preserve the world it replaces.----------------------------------------------------------------------MEDIAA Turning Point in the Digital Content WarThe conflict over digital media distribution and intellectual propertyis moving into a new phase.  The Recording Industry Association ofAmerica's (RIAA's) decision to file hundreds of lawsuits againstindividual file sharers was a turning point, the last gasp in thethree-year battle over peer-to-peer P2P file trading.  P2P systems area now chronic feature of the music industry.  They may become more orless popular, but they aren't going away.Two recent developments suggest where the conflict will move next.One is the increasing interest among P2P supporters of "alterativecompensation systems" that include compulsory licenses for digitalcontent.  In other words, a tax on users of the Internet or specificonline services to compensate artists and the music industry.  Theanalogies are radio and blank tapes, both of which have fees collectedto reimburse content creators.John Palfrey of the Berkman Center at Harvard Law School provides anexcellent overview of proposed compulsory license mechanisms now beingbatted around for digital music:	"These proposals suppose that the copyright system currently	used in the United States, Europe, and many other countries,	to stimulate and reward the development of digital content	would be replaced by a system in which the creators and	producers of such content were compensated by governments in	proportion to the frequency with which their products were	consumed."The folks at Berkman, which just received a substantial grant from theMacArthur Foundation to explore such alternative compensation systems,are to be complimented for their honesty.  These are mechanisms forgovernments to subsidize musicians by taxing ISPs.I think that's a bad idea.  Why not subsidize bloggers who createpopular posts?  Or creators of popular shareware?  Or great CSStemplates?  Let's all get on the gravy train!It's easy to throw around the idea of a 16-30% tax on Internet accessrates, collected from ISPs by sampling usage of digital media.  Inpractice, I'm certain such a system would be a mess.  The Internetworks as well as it does because it splits applications from access.Just because the radio industry is viable with ASCAP and BMIcollecting royalties for musicians and publishers doesn't mean that'sa good solution for the Internet.  I thought the private sector wantedto keep the Internet open and unregulated, unlike those traditionalbroadcast media industries?Meanwhile, various media reports suggest that Congressman Billy Tauzinwill soon take over as head of the Motion Picture Association ofAmerica.  I actually think this is good news for defenders of opennessand competition in the digital economy.  Tauzin will leave hispowerful position as chair of the House Commerce Committee, where heis an effective advocate for the interests of the incumbent telephonecompanies.  Second, he will replace Jack Valenti, whose supreme talentis his extraordinary gravitas.  Billy Tauzin is a partisan streetfighter.  A very skillful, exceedingly well-connected street fighter,which is why he's getting this plum job.  But someone who everyonesees as an advocate for one set of interest groups.Valenti is able to float above the political fray. His aloofnesssuggests that what Hollywood thinks is good for the movie industry isobviously good for America.  As the front man of Hollywood's crusadefor copyright absolutism, he has made an extremist position feeldownright reasonable.  Tauzin can't do that.  He may win his battles,but it will no longer be a secret that a war is going on.  The samedynamic is occurring with the departure of the thoughtful Hilary Rosenfrom the RIAA.The last, best hope to turn the tide in the conflict is for morepeople to realize that Larry Lessig is a centrist on copyright.  WithBilly Tauzin running the MPAA, perhaps the real policy spectrum willbe easier to perceive.----------------------------------------------------------------------SOFTWAREGoogle Constellation?Some of you may remember a product from Netscape around 1997 calledConstellation. This was back in the days when Netscape was ridinghigh, having rejected a huge buyout offer from Microsoft.Constellation was a frontal assault on the Windows franchise -- anattempt to make the browser the primary interface for accessing filesand applications.  Microsoft responded with various mechanisms to putWeb content on the Windows desktop, and tightly integrated InternetExplorer into Windows.  Of course, Constellation failed, Netscape lostits browser lead, and the company was never heard from again.  (Well,maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the idea.)So what is one to make of the new Google Deskbar<http://toolbar.google.com/deskbar/index.html>?  In an eerily paralleldevelopment, Google reportedly rejected a $10 billion buyout offerfrom Microsoft, and is now launching a product that puts Googledirectly onto the Windows desktop.  Google's executives are much wiserthat Netscape's, so you don't hear any sabre-rattling about how theyare going to crush Windows.  Google CEO Eric Schmidt has been at twocompanies -- Sun and Novell -- that bore the brunt of successfulMicrosoft assaults, so you can bet he understands the game he'spaying.Perhaps Google has to go after Windows, or be a sitting duck whenMicrosoft comes after its search franchise.  That's clearly whatMicrosoft intends.  With its extraordinary financial and researchassets, Microsoft can close the technical gap with Google's searchengine.  Whether it can overcome Google's mindshare is anotherquestion.----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERESTING LINKS FROM NOVEMBER 2003http://www.convergedigest.com/Bandwidth/newnetworksarticle.asp?ID=9434Verizon to launch offer voice over IP over broadband in 2004http://www.thefeature.com/article?articleid=100213The Triumph of Good Enough, my column for The Feature on convergedmobile deviceshttp://tinyurl.com/vumcScary Financial Times article on the upcoming World Summit onInformation Societyhttp://tinyurl.com/vumdSeattle Times piece on Michael Powell's spectrum policieshttp://www.shirky.com/writings/semantic_syllogism.htmlClay Shirky attacks the Semantic Webhttp://arnoldkling.com/%7Earnoldsk/aimst5/valenti.htmlArnold Kling gets mad about the FCC's Broadcast Flag requirementhttp://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/stories/storyReader$450Overview of alternative compensation systems for digital mediahttp://www.infoworld.com/article/03/10/28/HNstoragedoubles_1.htmlFive exabytes of information produced in 2002 (that's a big number)http://www.ventureblog.com/articles/indiv/2003/000203.htmlWhat Dartmouth is learning from its VOIP and WiFi installations----------------------------------------------------------------------If you are aware of others who would like to receive the SupernovaReport, please forward this email and copy supernova@pulver.com.
