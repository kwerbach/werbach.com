<title>Policies vs. Politics</title>
<link>http://werbach.com/blog/archives/2004/11/policies_vs_pol.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Postrel hits on something interesting in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/04/business/04scene.html?pagewanted=2">New York Times article</a> based on a <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty /glaeser/papers.html">paper</a> by a group of Harvard economists.  The paper is about religion in politics, but she draws two broader conclusions:<br />
<blockquote>Yet abortion rates show no significant change with the party in office, while tax rates rise significantly under Democrats - the opposite of what the political rhetoric promises. This result suggests that politicians move away from the social center mostly to get votes ("strategic extremism") and diverge from the economic center because they actually prefer those policies ("nonstrategic extremism").</p>

<p>Since the success of extreme messages depends on keeping your supporters better informed than your opponents, the model suggests that changing news media could be as important as changing social groupings.</blockquote><br />
Sounds right to me.  The second point is intriguing because it suggests that getting the "liberal media" out of its elite, coastal shell might actually hurt the cultural conservatives who complain about it. </p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>OK, Bush won.  I don't like it, but it's a fact.  He won with all the legitimacy his election lacked in 2000.  But the way he won re-election scares me, even more than last time.  </p>

<p>I can tolerate four more years of smirky George W. Bush in the White House.  I can tolerate a foreign policy I consider dangerous, but which is rooted in a geopolitical vision that I can respect.  And I can tolerate economic policies I consider ill-conceived and selfish, but which will benefit people like me in the short run.  </p>

<p>What I can't tolerate, as a religious person, is the notion that God took sides in this election.  <br />

<description><![CDATA[<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"That's what broadband
technology is.  It means we'll open the highways of knowledge -- new
highways of knowledge." <br>
</div>
-- <span style="font-style: italic;">President George W. Bush, </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/03/20040326-9.html">March 26, 2004</a>

<p>You'd think he would at least give Al Gore credit for the metaphor.</p>

<p>Bush's call in the speech for universal broadband by 2007 has gotten press attention, but not the second half of his sentence:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"We ought to have a universal,
affordable access for broadband technology by the year 2007, and then
we ought to make sure as soon as possible thereafter, consumers have
got plenty of choices when it comes to purchasing the broadband
carrier."<br>
</div>
<br>
The good news is that Bush acknowledges that only with competition will
broadband be affordable and a platform for innovation.&nbsp; The bad
news is that he's for monopoly broadband by a date-certain three years
from now, and competitive broadband "as soon as possible."&nbsp; Why do
I suspect his administration will do more to achieve the first goal
than the second one?<br>

<description><![CDATA[<p>The Chicago Tribune has an <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/technology/chi-0403210294mar21,1,1533532.story?coll=chi-techtopheds-hed">article </a>about<br />
the FCC's various proposals to open up more wireless capacity, with<br />
several quotes from me.&nbsp; The different aspects of open spectrum<br />
get a bit muddled, such as the distinction between current initiatives<br />
like the FCC's broadcast underlay proceeding and long-term proposals<br />
like my <a href="http://werbach.com/research/supercommons.pdf">supercommons</a> idea.&nbsp; Still, it's good to see the big idea of open spectrum getting play in a mainstream newspaper.<br></p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm speaking next week at the <a href="http://www.internationalunity.org">Internet Commons Congress</a><br />
at the University of Maryland.&nbsp; The name is a bit over the top,<br />
and I was hoping the organizers would be able to get more of the<br />
thinkers defining the "commons" vision (like Yochai Benkler, Larry<br />
Lessig, and Elinor Ostrom).&nbsp; Still it's an excellent group of<br />
actvitists involved in the various battles to preserve an open and<br />
vibrant digital commons.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The topics couldn't be more important.&nbsp; And registration is free.<br></p>

<title>SXSW Wrap-up</title>
<link>http://werbach.com/blog/archives/2004/03/sxsw_wrapup.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>I had a wonderful time at <a href="http://www.sxsw.com">South By Southwest Interactive</a>.&nbsp;<br />
There was an unusually high concentration of people I know virtually or<br />
have spoken with by phone, but had never actually met before in<br />
person.&nbsp; It was an incredibly fertile environment.&nbsp; And kudos<br />
to Hugh Forrest, Jon Lebkowsky, and the other organizers for giving<br />
significant attention to open spectrum and other topics that aren't yet<br />
widely appreciated.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Despite all this, I was disappointed by two things at the<br />
conference.&nbsp; The first was the odd hostility of the venue to the<br />
freewheeling, interpersonal networking that should be the hallmark of a<br />
conference like this.&nbsp; There was the <a href="http://werbach.com/blog/2004/03/14.html#a1451">bizarre prohibition </a>on<br />
using power outlets (later rescinded), and a large number of volunteers<br />
in every hallway whose job was to prevent you from walking into another<br />
part of the conference.&nbsp; That's right, the "interactive" people<br />
weren't allowed to talk with the "film" people.&nbsp; It often wasn't<br />
obvious which rooms were in which territory, and at one point I<br />
couldn't get to the speaker green room because it was on the wrong side<br />
of the line.</p>

<p>SXSW has complicated multi-tiered registration rates, and evidently the<br />
goal was to prevent people from getting more than they paid for.&nbsp;<br />
Still, there's a little thing happening called "convergence."&nbsp;<br />
It's odd for a tech-savvy festival about film, music, and interactive<br />
communication to be erecting barriers between people.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My other disappointment was that most of the sessions just weren't that<br />
exciting.&nbsp; The panel discussions didn't always do justice to the<br />
people involved, and many of the topics felt a bit stale or cliched<br />
(aka, How to Make Money with Blogs).&nbsp; Maybe I'm just jaded, or too<br />
far ahead of the mainstream.&nbsp; There were some great sessions,<br />
including the keynote by two of the organizers of MoveOn, and I had two<br />
leave half-way through the four-day event.&nbsp; I just expected more,<br />
given the reputation of the event and the people who were there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope to be back next year.&nbsp; And I left with a bunch of ideas for cool things to do at <a href="http://www.supernova2004.com/">Supernova</a>.<br></p>
