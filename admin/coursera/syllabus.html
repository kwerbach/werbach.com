  <p><em><strong>This is the planned syllabus for the Coursera massive open online course on <a href="https://class.coursera.org/gamification-002/class">Gamification</a>, taught by Professor <a href="http://werbach.com">Kevin Werbach</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kwerb">@kwerb</a>) from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. </strong></em></p>
  <p>The course is divided  into 12 units, which are in turn divided into short video lecture segments.  Think of each unit as one class session in an in-person course: there are two units per week, each of which includes 45-60 minutes of material. There are also quizzes, written assignments, and a final exam with specific due dates. </p>
<p>The course is completely free, and there are no required texts. You may find Prof. Werbach's book <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-Win-Thinking-Revolutionize-Business/dp/1613630239">For the Win</a></strong> helpful, as it mostly covers the same topic areas of the course, in greater detail and with additional examples and frameworks. It is <a href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/retailers/for-the-win/">available in ebook and paperback format</a> from Wharton Digital Press.  In the syllabus below, there are links to other suggested readings and videos for further insights into the topics.  </p>
<h3>1]  What is Gamification? </h3>

<p><em>After the introductory material on the course, the first topic we need to cover is what gamification actually means.  As we’ll see, there isn’t universal agreement.  However, there are a set of concepts and examples that are clearly within the scope of gamification.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><strong>1.1 Introduction
</strong>
<li><strong>1.2 Course overview and logistics
</strong>
<li><strong>1.3 Gamification defined
</strong>
<li><strong>1.4 Why study gamification? 
</strong>
<li><strong>1.5 History of gamification 
</strong>
<li><strong>1.6 Categories and examples</strong>
