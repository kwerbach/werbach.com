<a name="HTML"><h2>The Development of HTML</h2></a>
</p>

<p>HTML is the markup language used to create World Wide Web
documents.  Although official HTML specifications have been in
development for some time, individual Web browsers may recognize
proprietary tags that are not included
in the specifications.  When most people ask for a list of &quot;all the
HTML tags&quot; they generally want to know which tags they can
include in their pages with reasonable certainty that people viewing those
pages will see what the author wants.  <em>The Bare Bones Guide to
HTML</em> is
designed to meet this need.  I have attempted to include all of the tags
supported by major browsers today, but there are a number of nuances that
make
this an inherently imprecise process.</p>

<p>
The official standards body for HTML is the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C),
which is affiliated with the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">Internet
Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF).  The W3C has issued several
versions of the HTML specification, including HTML 2.0, HTML 3.0, and
most recently, HTML 3.2.  At the same time, however, browser
manufacturers, such as Netscape and Microsoft, have often developed
their own "extensions" to HTML outside of the standards process and
incorporated them into their browsers.  In some cases, such as Netscape's
&lt;CENTER&gt; tag, these extensions have become <i>de facto</i>
standards adopted by other browser manufacturers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html-spec/">HTML
2.0</a>, which codified the current state of HTML as of June, 1994, is the
baseline standard that all browsers today -- including text-based browsers --
should support.  HTML 2.0 reflects the original conception of HTML as a
device-independent markup language for displaying the organization of
information, rather than specifying exactly how pages should be displayed. 
If you want to be sure that all users will be able to view everything on your
pages, use only HTML 2.0 tags.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/html3/">HTML 3.0
draft</a>, issued in 1995, attempted to build upon HTML 2.0 with the
addition of features such as tables and greater control of text flow around
graphics.  Although some HTML 3.0 features were widely adopted by
browser developers, many were not.  In some cases, alternative
approaches implemented by browser developers became more widespread
than the &quot;official&quot; tags.  The HTML 3.0 draft has now expired,
and is therefore no longer an official standard.</p>

<p>In May 1996, W3C released the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur/">HTML 3.2
draft</a>, which was designed to reflect and standardize
generally-accepted practices.  Therefore, HTML 3.2 includes the HTML
3.0 tags that were adopted by browser developers such as Netscape and
Microsoft, as well as widely-supported extensions to HTML.  In its <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Activity">Position
Statement on HTML</a>, W3C recommends that information providers use
the HTML 3.2 specification.  Therefore, version 3.0 of the Bare Bones
Guide to HTML includes all the HTML 3.2 tags.  The current versions of
major browsers should support all, or virtually all, these tags.</p>

<p>There are also some Netscape and Microsoft extensions to HTML that
are not part of the HTML 3.2 draft, either because they are less
widely-used, or because they were implemented after the HTML 3.2
specification was written.  Because Netscape Navigator was among the
first browsers to support certain HTML 3.0 features, and Netscape controls
something like 70% of the browser market, many
people erroneously believe that all the Netscape extensions (including tags
such as &lt;BLINK&gt; and features such as Frames) are part of HTML 3.0
or HTML 3.2. </p>

<p>In deciding whether to use any of the tags listed as Netscape or
Microsoft extensions, remember that people using other browsers may not
see your pages rendered the way you intend.  You should also take into
account that there is no guarantee non-standard tags will be supported by
future browsers.  So it's up to you whether to use the Netscape and
Microsoft tags.  Many people have strong feelings about whether or not
you should use tags that are not part of the official HTML standard.  My
view is that as long as you understand
the difference, you should do whatever works best for you and for your
audience.  The Bare Bones Guide to HTML reflects this approach.  The
Guide is not an official specification, but it should give you an idea of which
tags are widely implemented and which standard they conform to.</p>

<a name="prologue"><h2>Prologue</h2></a>

<p>The prologue item should go at the very beginning of your file.  The
prologue is not required for browsers to recognize an HTML document,
although this can provide browsers and people reading your HTML source
file with an indication of which tags a includes.  The exact syntax of the
prologue varies depending on which version of the HTML DTD (document
type definition) you are using.  I've included the prologue to use if your
document conforms to HTML 3.2; don't use this if you include Netscape or
Microsoft extensions.</p>

<a name="xmp"><h2>&lt;XMP&gt;</h2></a>

<p>The current HTML specification recommends against using the
&lt;XMP&gt; tag, because it causes &quot;a number of unfortunate
interactions with processing techniques and tends to be used and
implemented inconsistently.&quot;  The &lt;PRE&gt; tag should be used
instead.</p>

<a name="blockquote"><h2>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</h2></a>

<p>The suggested rendering of the &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; tag is to indent
the left
and right margins, and this tag is frequently used to achieve indenting
(which
HTML 2.0 does not support directly) rather than for quoted material.  Be
aware that not all browsers display the tag this way, although more
browsers seem to be indenting it as time goes on.</p>

<a name="align"><h2>Alignment Tags</h2></a>

<p>The HTML 3.2 draft supports both the alignment attributes for
paragraph and header tags, and the &lt;CENTER&gt; tag originally
developed by Netscape.  These days, the main area in which &lt;CENTER&gt; is
necessary is in situations (such as centering a table in Netscape Navigator), 
where a browser doesn't recognize the alignment attributes.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with &lt;CENTER&gt; is that it implies
a paragraph break around the centered material, but browsers that don't
recognize the &lt;CENTER&gt; tag will simply ignore it, and thus not render
the document the way the author intended it.  As more browsers today recognize
the alignment tags, using &lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;/P&gt; will
increasingly be preferable to the nonstandard &lt;CENTER&gt; tag.</p>

<a name="paragraph"><h2>The &lt;P&gt; Tag</h2></a>

<p>Most HTML tags are &quot;containers;&quot; they have a beginning
and an ending tag, with text in the middle (e.g. &lt;B&gt;This is in
boldface&lt;/B&gt;).  The &lt;P&gt; tag, by contrast, was originally defined
as a standalone tag that marked the space between paragraphs.  The
problem
with this approach is that it didn't allow for features such as centering and
right-aligned paragraphs, because there was no way to mark the beginning
and
end of the text to be aligned.  Consequently, the HTML 3.0 proposal from
its
early days has defined &lt;P&gt; as a container tag, so that paragraphs
should
be represented as &lt;P&gt;Here's some text&lt;/P&gt;, and the opening
&lt;P&gt; tag can contain alignment and other attributes.  The closing
&lt;/P&gt; tag can often be left off when you are not setting the alignment
of a paragraph, although using it may make the boundaries of paragraphs
cleaner in your HTML source file.</p>

<a name="color"><h2>Color Tags</h2></a>
<p>
Color values are entered in the form of a hexadecimal triplet specifying red, green, and blue
values.  My <a href="http://werbach.com/web/wwwhelp.html#color">WWW Help Page</a> 
has a section of links to utilities that can generate these codes for you.

<a name="tables"><h2>Table Tags</h2></a>

<p>There is still some debate about the table tags, especially Netscape's
method of allowing table and column width to be specified as a percentage
in addition to an absolute number of pixels.  For the most part, however, the
implementation of tables is now consistent across the major browsers.</p>
