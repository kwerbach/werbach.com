<p align=right><font size=6><b>1.</b><br>the 21st century can't be reduced to a set of
principles</p></font>

<p align=right>
<b>Corollary 1</b>: don't believe anyone who is trying to sell you something.</p>

<p align=right><b>Corollary 2</b>: no one
predicted the rapid dominance of fax machines, PCs, xerox copiers, cable TV, and Snapple;
in fact the leaders, deep thinkers, and visionaries of all those industries made foolish
predictions about how those things would never amount to much.  Don't be so stupid as to
think you can predict the &quot;killer apps&quot; of the next century, or even the next
decade or year.</p>

<p align=right><font size=6><b>2.</b><br>nonlinearity</p></font>

<p align=right>
According to folklore, Columbus discovered that the world isn't flat.  In the whirrled
neither is the printed page.  The 21st century is a hypertext universe. 
It's postmodernism pushed to its fullest extreme.

<p align=right><font size=6><b>3.</b><br>space means nothing -- time means
everything</p></font>

<p align=right>
Distances between people are irrelevant because of advances in transportation and
communications.  And yet,  there are still only 24 hours in a day, and now you don't have
the luxury of waiting a week for that package to come in the mail before your boss wants
you to write your report.</p>

<p align=right><b>Corollary</b>:  Power in the 21st century will derive from the
ability to organize your life amid the sea of information that will bombard us, or the
ability to sell tools that give other people that ability.

<p align=right>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.  We're living in a candy-store
world created by
technology and mass-production; that imposes on us a responsibility not to be apathetic,
and to think about something other than ourselves.

<p align=right><font size=6><b>7.</b><br>the future is now</font></p>

<p align=right>According to Francis Fukuyama (following Hegel), we're at the end of
history.  We're closer
to the 21st century than we are to Ronald Reagan's presidency, and closer to Jean-Luc
Picard than to Leonardo Da Vinci.  Live in the now, man!</p>

<p align=right><font size=6><b>8.</b><br>opposites are true.  now what?</font></p>

<p align=right>One way of characterizing the history of philosophy is as breaking down a
series of
fundamental propositions, deconstructing at an ever-deeper level until we have nothing but
Derrida's &quot;freeplay of the signifier&quot;.  (cf. Hegel's thesis/antithesis leading to
synthesis) This is also true in many other fields; all normative statements can be
undermined.  For any characterization we make about the 21st, we can also make the opposite
characterization.  E.g.: technology will set us free/technology will enslave us; we are
entering a new age of grassroots activism/we are entering a new age of profound apathy; the
social order is falling apart/new social organizations are forming; &quot;high
culture&quot; is valuable/&quot;pop culture&quot; is profound; Neil Diamond is offal/Neil
Diamond is a songwriting genius; the profit motive corrupts/buy our book.  Just going
around and pointing out contradictions, or seeking to prove that the
bases for deeply-held beliefs can be undermined, gets us nowhere.  We have to decide how to
live our lives even though, as Nietzche says, God is dead (and, I add, so is Kurt Cobain).

<p align=right><font size=6><b>9.</b><br>we need pop philosophy</font></p>

<p align=right>We have pop music and pop psychology; why not pop philosophy?  Bring
philosophy out of the
ivory tower and use it to make sense of a confused world.  Marxism is dead, but Marx's
thesis on Feuerbach lives -- &quot;philsophers have interpreted the world.  Now the task is
to change it.&quot;</p>

<p align=right><font size=6><b>10.</b><br>the rules have changed, but it's still the same
game</font></p>

<p align=right>Underneath it all, we all want the same thing people have always wanted: to
find happiness
and meaning in life.  Don't be afraid to do what makes you truly happy (but learn to
distinguish happiness from momentary pleasure, which has value but of a different sort),
never stop yourself from expressing what you believe in (but always question your beliefs),
and always take action when deep down you know something is right (but always be mindful of
the tragedy of the commons).</p>
