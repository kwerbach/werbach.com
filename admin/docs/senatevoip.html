        <p><br>
  Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Commerce Committee, thank you for the opportunity
    to testify on the implications of voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) technology. </p>
        <p>This is an extraordinarily important issue for the US economy and
          the American people. We are witnessing the most significant change
          in telecommunications since Alexander Graham Bell called out for Mr.
          Watson. The growth of IP-enabled communications signifies nothing less
          than the transformation of the telecom industry, and the entire information
          sector that depends upon it. </p>
        <p>The decisions regarding VOIP that the Congress, the FCC, and state
          regulators make will determine the path of this transformation. Will
          we try to put the genie back in the bottle, by subjecting VOIP and
          other real-time Internet applications to legacy regulatory obligations?
          Or will we take a forward-looking approach, recognizing the extraordinary
          economic benefits VOIP can provide, and continuing America's global
          leadership in information and communications technology? That is the
          fundamental choice this committee faces today.</p>
        <p>I am the founder of the Supernova Group, an independent technology
          analysis and consulting firm. Earlier in my career, I had the honor
          of serving as Counsel for New Technology Policy at the Federal Communications
          Commission. I participated in the Commission's efforts, beginning nearly
          a decade ago, to understand a new phenomenon we called &quot;Internet
          telephony.&quot; The FCC wisely decided to allow that technology to
          develop outside the constraints of legacy common carrier regulation.
          Following its longstanding approach to &quot;enhanced&quot; or &quot;information&quot; services,
          the FCC created a space for the nascent VOIP technology to develop. </p>
        <p>As a result, investment and technological innovation has driven rapid
          development of VOIP, despite an extended downturn in the communications
          sector. The growth of VOIP has occurred not because it's a regulatory
          arbitrage trick, but because it's a better technology. It is more efficient,
          and more flexible, than the legacy circuit-switched technology. That
          is why all significant industry participants, including the Regional
          Bell Operating Companies, are deploying VOIP equipment within their
          networks in place of circuit switches. </p>
        <p>This is a true success story of regulatory forbearance creating new
          growth opportunities. VOIP is already used significantly for office
          phone systems and for national and global backbone transport. Cisco
          alone has sold more than two million IP phones to enterprise customers.
          And research firm IDC estimates that 10 percent of worldwide voice
          traffic already uses VOIP technology in some manner. </p>
        <p>The widespread rollout of broadband has created an opportunity to
          deliver VOIP directly to end-users as an application on top of data
          connectivity. This is a crucial conceptual shift, which I will explain
          later in my testimony. As a practical matter, broadband deployment
          allowed new entrants like Vonage and Packet8 to inject new competition
          into the local phone market. More than 100,000 Americans now subscribe
          to consumer voice over broadband offerings. And major players such
          as AT&amp;T, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Qwest have announced plans
          to launch voice over broadband offerings in the near future. In short,
          VOIP is helping to fulfill the promises of competition, lower prices,
          and innovation that Congress hoped to achieve when it passed the Telecommunications
          Act of 1996. </p>
        <p>It is now time for government to address the thorny policy issues
          that VOIP raises. The greatest threat to the continued growth of VOIP
          today is regulatory uncertainty and a patchwork of inconsistent decisions
          by state regulators and the FCC. We need a national policy that encompasses
          VOIP and the intertwined issues of universal service and inter-carrier
          compensation.</p>
        <p>What VOIP Is... and Isn't</p>
        <p>Voice over IP isn't simply another form of telephone service as we
          know it. It is the leading edge of a new communications paradigm. Until
          now, telephony has been tied to a specific kind of network and a particular
          industry structure. The service and the infrastructure were one and
          the same. </p>
        <p>In a digital broadband world, however, there is one network of networks
          tied together by common technical protocols. The infrastructure that
          delivers Web pages and files can also carry voices and moving pictures.
          Voice is just one class of application, which can be implemented in
          many different ways. And telephony is just one of a plethora of voice
          applications. </p>
        <p>It's worth explaining what I mean by voice as an application. The
          Internet is a connectivity platform. At its core, it is a set of technical
          and architectural protocols for interconnecting digital networks. Those
          networks can incorporate any physical media capable of carrying digital
          bits, and they can transport any application or content that can be
          encoded into those digital bits. </p>
        <p>To a data network, a voice call is nothing more than an instant message
          with different latency and reliability characteristics. And indeed,
          all the major instant messaging providers such as Yahoo! and AOL offer
          voice chat capabilities in their applications today. </p>
        <p>Because voice is an application in an IP world, it need not be tied
          to transmission facilities. I can load a piece of software called a
          softphone client onto my laptop computer or a handheld personal digital
          assistant and turn that device into a voice communications end-point.
          If I then use that device to call my friends, who is the service provider
          that would be subject to Title II regulation? The software vendor?
          The laptop manufacturer? My broadband provider? What if I'm online
          through a WiFi wireless hotspot in a Starbucks? </p>
        <p>I can now buy a $50 Webcam from a company like Logitech, plug it into
          my PC, and use it to engage in free or very low-cost videoconferencing
          with other computer users around the world. Or I can subscribe to the
          online services associated with Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's
          Xbox video game consoles, and chat live with other players in the same
          game. Or I can download a piece of free software called Skype and use
          it to make calls to other Skype users through a web of direct peer-to-peer
          connections, with no central network. Skype has announced free five-way
          conferencing, so that every call can instantly become a multipoint
          conference. </p>
        <p>As these examples show, VOIP is much more than services that may,
          from a distance, look similar to traditional circuit-switched voice
          telephony. The legacy telecom regulatory framework is based on the
          idea of a call that originates and terminates between subscribers at
          defined locations, through a circuit established by one or more carriers.
          None of these concepts necessarily endures in an IP world. </p>
        <p>Trying to separate out unregulated from regulated VOIP applications
          will prove to be a futile exercise. For example, if the full panoply
          of legacy regulation and taxes apply to a service that uses an ordinary-looking
          phone, providers will have incentives to make their terminal equipment
          look less like an ordinary phone. Instead of engaging in regulatory
          whack-a-mole, we must step back and examine the point of those obligations
          and taxes. </p>
        <p>The Layered Model</p>
        <p>All of this leads to the question now before this Committee: what
          policy approaches to VOIP will best serve the interests of the American
          people? </p>
        <p>Let's be clear on what is not in dispute. No one in the VOIP debate
          questions that law enforcement agencies should have access, subject
          to appropriate procedural safeguards, to the information they need
          to do their jobs. No one questions the need to support emergency services
          such as 911, or to ensure that Americans with disabilities have access
          to essential communications services. And no one questions the enduring
          value of universal service to ensure that all Americans receive the
          benefits of telecommunications. </p>
        <p>However, we must recognize that the communications world is changing.
          The way we meet those essential goals will change along with it. Just
          because certain mechanisms were used in the past doesn't make them
          sacrosanct. And if the system is flawed, or has not kept up with the
          rapid pace of technological development, we should not curtail that
          development in an effort to fix it. The challenge is to achieve our
          essential social policy goals at the least cost to innovation, investment,
          and competition. </p>
        <p>I'd like to offer a general framework and a specific set of recommendations. </p>
        <p>As a general matter, the legal framework for converged data networks
          should reflect the architecture of those networks. Engineers use the
          concept of layering to describe how data networks operate. The underlying
          physical transmission is a separate layer from the addressing and routing
          mechanisms that deliver traffic to the right points on the network,
          which is separate from the applications that encode and decode that
          traffic, and which is separate from the traffic itself. Open connectivity
          between those layers ensures innovation and competitive deployment
          of new applications.</p>
        <p>The traditional communications regulatory framework classifies services
          into horizontal categories such as telecommunications and broadcasting.
          From that initial classification flow a host of legal obligations.
          If VOIP and other real-time Internet applications are deemed telecommunications
          services under the 1996 Act, they would be subject to the full panoply
          of regulation designed for circuit-switched carriers.</p>
        <p>A layered approach to communications regulation, which I have outlined
          in some of my writings, would approach the problem differently. It
          would distinguish among content, applications, addressing, and physical
          connectivity. Competitive issues of market power and interconnection
          primarily concern the physical layer. If the physical layer is open,
          there is little or no need to regulate what runs on top. That is the
          lesson of the Internet, which emerged because Internet service providers
          and application providers like Yahoo!, Amazon.com, and eBay had nondiscriminatory
          access to underlying telecommunications networks. </p>
        <p>The FCC, in its recent decision that Pulver.com's Free World Dialup
          service is an unregulated information service, effectively found such
          a layered model already present in the 1996 Act. The statutory distinction
          between telecommunications services and information services, derived
          from the FCC's earlier basic/enhanced division, recognizes that data
          applications ride on top of regulated transmission pipes. </p>
        <p>Of course Congress, unlike the FCC, has the power to change the Act.
          Any reform of the 1996 Act should make the data-centric, layered model
          more explicit. IP is the future of the network. </p>
        <p>Specific Policy Issues</p>
        <p>Turning to the specific questions we have been asked to consider for
          this hearing, there are three kinds of policy obligations that potentially
          impact on VOIP:</p>
        <p>-	Economic regulation to ensure effective market competition.<br>
  - Universal service policies designed to achieve social goals for availability
    of telecommunications itself.<br>
  - Policies to support other social goals, such as law enforcement, access for
  people with disabilities, emergency services, local taxation, and consumer
  protection. </p>
        <p>It seems quite clear that the bulk of the economic regulation in Title
          II of the Communications Act should not apply to VOIP. Common carrier
          regulation was designed for dominant incumbents like the old AT&amp;T
          and today's Baby Bells. In the VOIP space, there is no such incumbent.
          Moreover, so long as the incumbent network owners do not discriminate,
          there will never be a VOIP provider with that degree of control. VOIP
          is an application using standard protocols. The barriers to entry are
          low, and the opportunities for innovation are high. </p>
        <p>Application of legacy regulation to VOIP would do more than just stifle
          innovation in new competitive phone services. It would cast a pall
          of uncertainty over the entire technology sector. Would Microsoft be
          subject to those obligations for its Xbox Live online gaming chat service?
          Would a software provider that sells a VOIP softphone client to run
          on a handheld PocketPC or Palm device? Would Intel, for putting voice
          over WiFi phones into its reference designs for laptops, as it did
          last week at its developer forum? </p>
        <p>Universal service raises somewhat different issues. It is a collective
          benefit that requires collective contributions. It would be a sad irony,
          though, if those contribution obligations stifled the deployment of
          affordable and innovative new service offerings. We must distinguish
          universal service, the important public policy objective, from the
          existing maze of hidden cross-subsidies and regulatory charges. </p>
        <p>Moreover, just because some applications do not explicitly contribute
          to universal service funding mechanisms does not mean they provide
          no support to the system. Free World Dialup may be free, but its users
          must pay for a broadband connection, typically to a local phone or
          cable operator. Companies such as Vonage and AT&amp;T pay for the circuits,
          transport, origination and termination they need to deliver their VOIP
          traffic. A portion of those payments makes its way into universal service
          funding mechanisms. </p>
        <p>When the topic is VOIP and universal service, the elephant in the
          room is access charges. Whether VOIP applications are subject to access
          charges is not the same question as whether they contribute to universal
          service. Access charges are the non-cost-based, regulated rates that
          local exchange carriers charge interexchange carriers for originating
          and terminating telecommunications traffic. They are a descendant of
          internal accounting transfers by the old Ma Bell, subjected to twenty
          years of regulatory tinkering and industry horse-trading. They are
          just one of several inconsistent inter-carrier compensation regimes
          that telecommunications providers face, depending on the legal classification
          of traffic. The current system is artificial and unsustainable. </p>
        <p>Inter-carrier compensation needs to be reformed for the US telecom
          industry to move forward. The industry knows it. Press reports suggest
          that local and interexchange carriers have been negotiating to develop
          a consensus proposal for inter-carrier compensation reform. The FCC
          is also looking to act. Those efforts will only succeed if all parties
          have a reason to come to the table. Subjecting VOIP to access charges,
          especially before comprehensive inter-carrier compensation reform,
          would be the best way to derail those much-needed reforms. </p>
        <p>VOIP is just one factor putting pressure on the universal service
          and inter-carrier compensation regimes. Eight years after the passage
          of the 1996 Act, we still do not truly have the competitively-neutral,
          transparent, portable, explicit universal service funding system that
          the Act envisioned. Given the money at stake, this is the Bermuda Triangle
          of telecom regulation. Yet we must go there, if we want universal service
          to survive in the IP communications era. Attempting to regulate VOIP
          will not make the challenges facing universal service funding go away.
          It will simply create more confusion, limit competition, and delay
          the inevitable.</p>
        <p>The layered model suggests a possible alternative path to achieve
          our universal service goals. Take a look at the personal computer industry.
          Different companies make chips, build components, assemble computers,
          and develop software. Every layer is a platform. Competitors in each
          layer work to reduce prices and improve quality, with stunning results.
          The PC you buy today is many times more powerful than the PC you could
          buy five years ago, and sells for half the cost. Once only for the
          wealthy, PCs are now in two-thirds of American homes, and the number
          continues to grow. All without any government-mandated subsidies.</p>
        <p>The telephone business should follow the same path of rapid price
          reductions and performance enhancements as the PC business. Already,
          VOIP providers are introducing new price points and innovations such
          as area code mobility, real-time billing and service provisioning,
          and easy conference calling. They should be encouraged, not restrained. </p>
        <p>Finally, we come to social policy obligations such as CALEA, disability
          access, consumer protection, and emergency services. Especially in
          the post-9/11 era, there is no question that law enforcement authorities
          must have the tools they need to do their jobs. CALEA is one arrow
          in the quiver of law enforcement agencies seeking information to aid
          their investigations. It is not the only tool they have available.
          And even if VOIP application providers on top of telecommunications
          networks are not subject to CALEA, the telecommunications service providers
          they depend on still are. Furthermore, because VOIP decouples the voice
          application from underlying transport, the provider that interfaces
          with the end-user may only have access to the call routing information,
          not the content of the communication. </p>
        <p>The VOIP community must continue to work with law enforcement and
          national security agencies to find the most appropriate technical mechanisms
          for lawful access to information needed to support investigations.
          The FCC has announced its intention to launch a CALEA proceeding in
          the near future that will provide a public forum for these issues.
          There is no reason to short-circuit those processes. </p>
        <p>Similarly, there is no reason to assume that, without rapid application
          of traditional Title II regulation to VOIP, the other social policy
          objectives mentioned above will not be met. As with law enforcement
          access, there may be alternative sources of legal authority. Furthermore,
          VOIP providers have already developed voluntary mechanisms to achieve
          goals such as interconnection with 911 and other public safety systems.
          Such industry efforts should be given an opportunity to succeed. If
          they do not, or cannot, achieve the necessary objectives in a reasonable
          period of time, regulators and Congress should consider the need for
          targeted action. </p>
        <p>Applying the full legacy regulatory regime to VOIP and other real-time
          Internet applications, simply to ensure that particular social policy
          objectives are met, would be a colossal case of the tail wagging the
          dog.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>Over the past decade, we have seen the benefits of a policy approach
          that shields Internet-based applications from unnecessary application
          of legacy regulation. Congress expressed its desire for an unregulated
          Internet in the 1996 Act, and the FCC has followed that direction in
          its regulatory proceedings. </p>
        <p>With VOIP, we are seeing the Internet realize its destiny. It is evolving
          into a converged network of networks that delivers an array of advanced
          applications, services, and content to all Americans. Perhaps even
          more powerfully, it is allowing individuals themselves to create and
          share information with their families, friends, communities, and extended
          social networks. </p>
        <p>We can embrace that future, or we can try to pull the Internet back
          into yesterday's regulatory system. Make no mistake. Broad-brush regulation
          of VOIP is tantamount regulation of Internet applications. From the
          network's perspective, a stream of voice bits is no different from
          an eBay auction or a Google search. </p>
        <p>The US led the world in Internet deployment. Other countries are rushing
          to catch up, and by some measures such as broadband penetration they
          have surpassed us. If we are to remain the leaders in the information-driven
          global economy of the 21st century, we must continue our enlightened
          policies to favor innovation and competitive markets, while remaining
          committed to our essential social, public safety, and national security
          goals. </p>
        <p>I commend the Committee for recognizing the need to address these
          critical issues.</p>
