				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m returning from a packed <a href="http://www.progressivepolicy.org/event/should-the-fcc-serve-as-internet-traffic-cop/">event</a>, hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, on the FCC’s role in Internet interconnection.  It was a good discussion.  And I&#8217;m glad to see these issues getting the attention they deserve.  I was the only panelist calling for an ongoing FCC role as a backstop for interconnection agreements, which I’ve advocated in my <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=964991">Only Connect</a> (2007) and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241658">No Dialtone</a> (2014) papers.  The others were more concerned about the dangers of regulation than the threats from anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>It was an interesting reversal from the conversations I’ve been involved in the past month about network neutrality.  I seem to be one of the few experts who likes FCC Chairman Wheeler&#8217;s proposed approach of using authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to protect the open Internet.  Most of those who, like me, believe that’s an important goal see the only solution as reclassifying broadband access as a regulated &#8220;telecommunications service.&#8221; The FCC is, appropriately, asking questions about both approaches.</p>
<p>One reason I think the 706 route is simpler and more direct is that it’s the only approach to FCC jurisdiction in this area that has actually been validated in court.  It may well be that reclassification could make it through the legal gauntlet, not to mention the political gauntlet, but there’s a fair distance from there to there.</p>
<p>Just before Memorial Day weekend, there was another decision that strengthened the FCC’s hand under Section 706.  In a case involving the FCC’s reform of universal service funding, rural telephone companies and others argued that the FCC had no authority to mandate the availability of broadband.  By retaining its classification of broadband access as an “information service,” they argued, the FCC gave up its ability to utilize the public policy tools that traditionally applied to regulated telecommunications carriers.  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The court independently reached the same conclusion as the District of Columbia Circuit, which decided the <em>Verizon v. FCC</em> case about network neutrality.  Section 706(b), the 10th Circuit found, gives the FCC independent authority to take appropriate steps that it deems necessary to promote broadband deployment.  Calling something an information service doesn’t establish a regulation-free zone. It just puts limits on the FCC’s actions to meet the terms of Section 706, and to allow companies some room for individualized negotiation.  Which strikes me as not inherently a bad thing.</p>
<p>For both Internet interconnection and network neutrality, the challenge is to implement an approach somewhere between the intrusive price regulation traditionally applied to common carriers, on the one hand, and blindness to the dangers of gatekeepers in network industries on the other. I continue to believe that, while there are other routes the FCC could have taken over the past decade, and Congress should by now have fixed a communications law that everyone agrees is broken, our best bet is to accept reality as we find it.  The Section 706 approach isn’t pretty, but it seems to work in court. For anyone familiar with the FCC&#8217;s less-than-sterling judicial record in recent decades, that shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>As Yogi Berra once said, “If you come to a fork in the road, take it.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve posted my draft paper, <a title="Higher Standards" href="http://tinyurl.com/d5tekt">Higher Standards: Regulation in the Network Age</a> (Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology, forthcoming 2009) to the SSRN online repository.Â  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">As digital networks proliferate, standardized interfaces will define the economic and normative dynamics of markets. In other words, standardization is regulation. Regulatory mechanisms must evolve to emulate the best aspects of the standard-setting process. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should remake itself as a standards organization. Instead of viewing standardization as peripheral to its core mission, the FCC should catalyze adoption of open standards that promote its regulatory objectives.</span></p>
<p>A standards-based approach offers better solutions to the novel issues the FCC now faces, such as network management practices of broadband access providers and unlicensed wireless devices adjacent to broadcast television frequencies. Scholars have begun to appreciate the importance of technical standards in regulating the behavior of communications and information technology firms. However, they have only considered possibilities in which government either subsumes or defers to private standards-setting bodies. This article shows how regulators can see themselves as participants in the standards marketplace. Such an approach will allow the FCC to provide necessary &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; for development of technical solutions to important public policy disputes.</p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Needless to say, these are my own views and not those of the FCC or the Obama Transition Team, although my perspective is certainly influenced by what I saw during the Transition.Â  I welcome your comments and suggestions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile, the #4 US wireless carrier, is <a href="http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-t-mobile-usa-to-revamp-content-strategy-in-the-fall-to-mirror-apples-ap/">moving to an App Store model</a> for all its phones.Â  In other words, users will be able to choose their own applications, as they now do on Apple&#8217;s iPhone.Â  Along with Google Android/Open Handset Alliance, Verizon&#8217;s <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/61217/2007/11/verizon.html">open development initiative</a>, and the<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121842341491928977.html"> success of Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>, this is good news for wireless subscribers in the US.Â  For too long we&#8217;ve been stuck with a poor set of apps and features pre-selected by the carriers.</p>
<p>However, a series of walled application stores is not the same as an Internet-like open platform.Â  Developers still need to go through the bottleneck of Apple&#8217;s and T-Mobile&#8217;s (and soon, most likely, AT&amp;T&#8217;s and Sprint&#8217;s and Verizon&#8217;s) certification process, pricing policies, and so forth.Â  Not to mention that we&#8217;re just talking about the US here.Â  The US is a big mobile market, but less than a tenth of the the global handset total.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised how quickly the major US operators are backing off their policies of tightly controlling handsets and applications.Â  The question is whether the shift will stop at walled markets, or move toward a truly open environment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FCC reached a <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1778099,00.asp">decision</a> this week that could effectively end broadband service as we know it.  The order hasn&#8217;t officially come out yet, but the result was leaked.</p>
<p>The FCC granted a petition by BellSouth to pre-empt state regulators from requiring &#8220;naked DSL.&#8221;  The procedural aspects are convoluted, so the effect of that action may not be clear.  Here&#8217;s what the FCC is saying.  The local phone companies (and, although the ruling doesn&#8217;t specifically cover them, cable companies) are free to force customers to pay for phone service in order to get broadband.  Whether or not you use the phone company&#8217;s voice service is immaterial &#8212; you have to pay for it.  Although there are a few telcos willing to sell DSL as a stand-alone service (notably Qwest), one wonders if they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>The FCC ruling makes broadband an extension of phone service, rather than the reverse.  It ties the data applications of the future to the anchor of the public switched telephone network.  That&#8217;s perverse.  Voice is the application, not connectivity.  We&#8217;ll never have real competition if the incumbents get paid even when customers want to switch to a competitor.</p>
<p>I want to pay someone for high-speed data connectivity, with the opportunity to use (and pay for) innovative applications on top of that pipe.  To me, that&#8217;s broadband service.  After the FCC decision, that may no longer be available.  That&#8217;s what I mean by the end of broadband as we know it.  For the privilege of buying broadband, I&#8217;ll have to buy phone service or something else I don&#8217;t need, raising the effective price.  This is the way to promote broadband adoption in the US?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been interesting to watch the debate progress over the city of Philadelphia&#8217;s plan to create a city-wide outdoor public WiFi network.   The project generated a lot of attention when first announced.  At that time, Verizon and Comcast didn&#8217;t have much to say about it.  Then word leaked out that a bill in the Pennsylvania legislature would prohibit Philadelphia and other cities from engaging in such projects.  (After a firestorm of protest, Philadelphia got an exception.)</p>
<p>Now that the city has moved along with its plans, the incumbent phone and cable companies are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/17/technology/17wired.html?ei=5094&#038;en=f1e64f65642d068d&#038;hp=&#038;ex=1108702800&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;partner=homepage&#038;adxnnlx=1108645697-eb49opBXxDnJTNWcs3zbfw&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;position=">hardening their opposition</a>.  They are talking as though the governing is nationalizing broadband access.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The city of Philadelphia is doing what cities do &#8212; look for ways to provide valuable services to its citizens, when the market doesn&#8217;t meet the entire need.  It isn&#8217;t killing off private competitors.  City-run public housing competes with private real estate, and city buses compete with private cabs, but no one seems to have a problem with that.</p>
<p>What gets lost in this debate is that the city and its citizens will benefit in many other ways from a ubiquitous public WiFi network.  The city spends millions of dollars on wireless networks for police, fire department, and other city departments.  This will decrease costs and greatly increase capabilities for those service.  For example, think of how city building inspectors could use the network to access plans and send filings back in real-time.  And that&#8217;s just the start.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not allow reflexive opposition to &#8220;bureaucracies&#8221; to kill a worthwhile program.  Sometimes governments do good things too.</p>
