<p>I&#8217;ve also been meaning for a while to try out Medium, a popular new online publishing platform from Evan Williams, the guy behind Blogger and Twitter. So far, I like the experience. I&#8217;ll see whether I wind up moving more of my personal blogging there, instead of this site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m returning from a packed <a href="http://www.progressivepolicy.org/event/should-the-fcc-serve-as-internet-traffic-cop/">event</a>, hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, on the FCC’s role in Internet interconnection.  It was a good discussion.  And I&#8217;m glad to see these issues getting the attention they deserve.  I was the only panelist calling for an ongoing FCC role as a backstop for interconnection agreements, which I’ve advocated in my <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=964991">Only Connect</a> (2007) and <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241658">No Dialtone</a> (2014) papers.  The others were more concerned about the dangers of regulation than the threats from anticompetitive behavior.</p>
<p>It was an interesting reversal from the conversations I’ve been involved in the past month about network neutrality.  I seem to be one of the few experts who likes FCC Chairman Wheeler&#8217;s proposed approach of using authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to protect the open Internet.  Most of those who, like me, believe that’s an important goal see the only solution as reclassifying broadband access as a regulated &#8220;telecommunications service.&#8221; The FCC is, appropriately, asking questions about both approaches.</p>
<p>One reason I think the 706 route is simpler and more direct is that it’s the only approach to FCC jurisdiction in this area that has actually been validated in court.  It may well be that reclassification could make it through the legal gauntlet, not to mention the political gauntlet, but there’s a fair distance from there to there.</p>
<p>Just before Memorial Day weekend, there was another decision that strengthened the FCC’s hand under Section 706.  In a case involving the FCC’s reform of universal service funding, rural telephone companies and others argued that the FCC had no authority to mandate the availability of broadband.  By retaining its classification of broadband access as an “information service,” they argued, the FCC gave up its ability to utilize the public policy tools that traditionally applied to regulated telecommunications carriers.  Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The court independently reached the same conclusion as the District of Columbia Circuit, which decided the <em>Verizon v. FCC</em> case about network neutrality.  Section 706(b), the 10th Circuit found, gives the FCC independent authority to take appropriate steps that it deems necessary to promote broadband deployment.  Calling something an information service doesn’t establish a regulation-free zone. It just puts limits on the FCC’s actions to meet the terms of Section 706, and to allow companies some room for individualized negotiation.  Which strikes me as not inherently a bad thing.</p>
<p>For both Internet interconnection and network neutrality, the challenge is to implement an approach somewhere between the intrusive price regulation traditionally applied to common carriers, on the one hand, and blindness to the dangers of gatekeepers in network industries on the other. I continue to believe that, while there are other routes the FCC could have taken over the past decade, and Congress should by now have fixed a communications law that everyone agrees is broken, our best bet is to accept reality as we find it.  The Section 706 approach isn’t pretty, but it seems to work in court. For anyone familiar with the FCC&#8217;s less-than-sterling judicial record in recent decades, that shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>
<p>As Yogi Berra once said, “If you come to a fork in the road, take it.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Wheeler, the new Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, gave a <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/remarks-fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-ohio-state-university">speech</a> today at Ohio State University.  It was a good speech on his regulatory philosophy.  But that&#8217;s not so interesting.  There&#8217;s nothing out of the ordinary about a government official giving a speech.  The unusual development was that the Chairman also released an ebook, called <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/page/net-effects-past-present-and-future-impact-our-networks">Net Effects</a>.  Even more unusual, it&#8217;s not a bland ghostwritten policy whitepaper; it&#8217;s a deeply researched work of history.</p>
<p>The speech and ebook focus on something Wheeler calls the &#8220;network compact.&#8221;  He says it&#8217;s essential for the FCC to promote competition.  However, he recognizes there are some problems competition may not solve.  And there are some obligations that arise from the unique social importance of communications networks.  &#8220;Let the market work&#8221; is a great starting point, but if &#8220;the market&#8221; means no one picks up when you dial 911 in an emergency, we&#8217;ve got a problem.  I&#8217;ve made the same argument myself in a paper, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2241658">No Dialtone</a>, about the future of the telephone system.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s distinctive about Wheeler&#8217;s perspective is that it&#8217;s rooted in history.  (For those aware of Wheeler&#8217;s two prior books, both about the Civil War, this isn&#8217;t so surprising.)  Wheeler connects the current revolution of connected computing to the prior network revolutions of the printing press, the railroad, and the telegraph.  He draws from this a series of principles.  As important as the principles, though, is the insight Wheeler takes from the very act of doing history. As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It has been suggested that we are living through the greatest network revolution in history. On this the jury is still out. The reverse telescope of history makes prior experiences seem much smaller than they were.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the point of history isn&#8217;t to understand the past; it&#8217;s to appreciate the present.  By looking backwards, we can understand better how we got here, distill lessons from experience, and appreciate how similar situations looked to prior generations. That doesn&#8217;t work when we&#8217;re looking forward, because we have no perspective on the present.  We can project into the future, but we&#8217;re apt to get it wrong by relying on our fresh and localized perceptions of the current state of affairs.  Going back not just to the origins of the telephone and broadcasting, but to earlier networks that in their time were seen as equally revolutionary, helps to wash out the local details and throw the essential concepts into starker relief.  In this regard, Net Effects is the kind of work we should want our leaders to be studying, and doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made no secret that I believe Wheeler will be an outstanding FCC Chairman, based on personal experience with him.  When he was nominated, there was criticism because he spent much of his career leading two trade associations.  It&#8217;s entirely appropriate and ultimately necessary to judge him by his actions in the job, but words matter too.  This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen the leader of a major government agency start his term by publishing an ebook.  I hope it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Has anyone on the left suggested that Democrats unite around a set of process reforms for our broken political process? This would be the mirror image of the Republican &#8220;Contract With America&#8221; in 1994, which (A) was fantastically successful, ending 40 years of Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and (B) basically got us into the current mess. At a time when popular support for Congress is at 5%, wouldn&#8217;t you want to be the party of reform?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking of things like campaign finance, earmark reform, measures to end gerrymandering, and eliminating the ridiculous Hastert Rule that prevents measures supported by a large majority of the House from ever coming to a vote. Put together a package, and get current officeholders and candidates to sign on publicly. Yes, this would limit Democrats&#8217; ability to do evil things when they control Congress, but that&#8217;s a price worth paying, and Democrats don&#8217;t have the same anti-government bent anyway.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised no one is talking about this possibility. Everyone seems to be focused on substantive issues. It&#8217;s a broken system that allows a small group of extremists to bring the U.S. to the bring of catastrophe, folks. This is exactly what the Framers worried about in the Federalist Papers, and built in processes like checks and balances to avoid. Evidence from California (http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-shutdown-reform-20131019,0,5102606.story) suggests fixing the system actually produces a less partisan, more effective legislature.  Why not give it a shot?</p>
