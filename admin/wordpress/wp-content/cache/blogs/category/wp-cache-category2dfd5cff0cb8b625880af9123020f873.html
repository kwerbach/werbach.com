				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A couple months ago I posted on <a href="http://werblog.com/2013/08/teaching-and-performance/">teaching and performance</a>.  Here&#8217;s another perspective on the same broad topic. I started writing it a while back, but never finished. It answers many of the questions I posed in my other post.  I just don&#8217;t think I found those answers convincing.  </em></p>
<p><strong>Teaching is a form of learning.</strong></p>
<p>When I teach a course, the best way I&#8217;ve found to measure success is asking myself at the end whether I figured out what the course was really about.</p>
<p>Like most beginners, I assumed for years that the essence of a course was its content. As I started to read about pedagogy, I was realized this was dead wrong. The content is the last thing to start with when designing a course.  Pretty much any book you read about teaching in higher education makes this point.</p>
<p>But still something was missing. The first question in backwards course design is, &#8220;what do students need to know?&#8221; This question stopped me completely. I simply couldn&#8217;t answer it. Yes, I was the expert, the one designing the course. And yes, I accepted that courses should be about outputs rather than inputs. Yet somehow, asking what students <em>should </em>learn felt like smashing into a brick wall. I was stuck.</p>
<p>Then I realized why.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t possibly decide ahead of time what students need to know or what the course can teach them.  That&#8217;s something that has to emerge from the alchemy of teaching and learning.  It&#8217;s the part of education that you can&#8217;t get from a textbook, or Wikipedia, or Khan Academy, or perhaps, a MOOC. It&#8217;s the co-creation that occurs between an instructor and students, and more importantly, between students and each other.  A good teacher facilitates a conversation that generates one or more core lessons. A great teacher picks up on what those are, and makes them the focus of learning. None of that exists in the aether before the course begins.</p>
<p>The kind of teaching I&#8217;m describing involves the very real possibility of failure.  This is teaching as high wire act.  There is no guarantee even a master teacher can curate a learning conversation to a point of convergence.  A class whose success cannot be determined by what&#8217;s on the syllabus is a class that may turn out to be a waste of time, at least for some of the participants.</p>
<p><strong>The possibility of failure is a feature, not a bug.</strong>  Failure, as we know, is a key part of learning.  Only when we can fail are we reaching beyond ourselves. (Those who know more than I do about learning theory can insert a reference here to Vygotsky&#8217;s concept of proximal development.)  At the same time, it is only when failure doesn&#8217;t seem scary that we are willing to experiment.  That is one reason games are such exceptional learning tools.  They invite us to try and fail, and fail, and fail, until we eventually succeed. You can always start over with another life or a new session of the game.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;m still too afraid of failing as a teacher to open myself up to real learning.  Paradoxically, that makes it more likely that I&#8217;ll fail, or at least find my teaching experiences unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason I found my MOOC teaching in front of tens of thousands of students less scary than interacting in person with a few dozen of them is that we all knew going in that the MOOC was an experiment which could fail, and which the students at least could easily abandon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m participating in the <a href="https://opencourses.desire2learn.com/d2l/home/6669">#WWEOpen13</a> MOOC about open online teaching. For the first unit, we were asked to post our &#8220;teaching philosophy.&#8221;  These kinds of questions typically tie me in knots. They seem inherently circular and unsolvable: to say how I should teach, I need to know what students need to learn, which isn&#8217;t something I can just declare. For whatever reason, this time I was able to tap out ten statements.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d call them a philosophy, but they ring true as commitments I feel comfortable with.</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good teaching is good learning… for both the student and the instructor.  Learning means new connections and themes and lessons that weren&#8217;t there at the beginning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">I believe in a balance between what the instructor and the students contribute.  Teaching shouldn&#8217;t be a monologue, but it also shouldn&#8217;t be purely a peer conversation: students want the guidance and validation and knowledge that the instructor can orchestrate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Every student should feel they are part of the experience and encouraged to contribute their unique perspectives. In particular, students should not be unfairly disadvantaged by factors such as gender, race, national origin, language, or disability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good courses are well-designed interactive narratives, like good video games.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Attention is the most valuable resource in the world today. My job is to earn my students’ attention.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We live in a digitally connected world of ubiquitous access to information. Teaching that pretends otherwise will fail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment should reward effort. Those who try hard should do well. (Some of those who don’t try hard will also do well, based on sheer ability, but that’s less important.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment is feedback. It should tell both the students and the instructor something about how they are doing, with enough frequency to be useful and motivating.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Assessment is learning. It should teach the students something, not just verify what they’ve been taught.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Good teaching is fun. Both the students and the instructor should enjoy the experience. Great teaching is great fun.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the MOOC is about online teaching, I don&#8217;t see any reason to make that a point of distinction.  Techniques will vary between a small in-person course, a large in-person lecture, a synchronous online course, and a massive asynchronous MOOC, but one&#8217;s philosophy of teaching shouldn&#8217;t.  And I tend to see see all teaching, at least in higher ed, as a form of blended learning.  We should always use online for a what it does best, and in-person for what it does best.  Our pedagogy should be robust to such variation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Teaching is hard.  </strong>Some people are naturally good at it, and others are naturally quick at developing good teaching skills.  For most of us, though, figuring out how to teach effectively is a real challenge.</p>
<p>As a professor, teaching is a central aspect of what I do for a living.  I&#8217;m deeply committed to teaching well.  And today, social and technological developments are changing the context of teaching and learning in significant ways.  So we have an obligation to rethink what we do in light of the new environment.  Yet I find it hard to talk about teaching with others, at least in the university context that I&#8217;m in.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m trying something new.  I&#8217;ll post some thoughts in the hope of generating a conversation.  <strong>I welcome your thoughts and input.</strong></p>
<p>The starting point for me is that teaching and performance are connected, but distinct. Giving a spellbinding lecture is performance.  It may be good teaching or bad teaching.  It has the advantage (most likely) of getting students to show up, pay attention, and perhaps remember something of the experience for a long time.  All of those are correlated with good teaching.  They aren&#8217;t themselves teaching. Think of a brilliant actor on stage or a great episode of a TV show.  You wouldn&#8217;t call that teaching. It&#8217;s performance.  You might learn something by watching, but the quality of the performance doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate the quality of the learning. (And yes, I know that movies and games and other things can be <em>designed</em> to teach &#8212; I&#8217;m a gamification expert, after all! I&#8217;m talking about the normal ones designed primarily to entertain.)</p>
<p>Performance is an input; teaching is an output.  You can measure performance at the source, but you can only measure teaching at the receiver, which in this case is the student. As a consequence, performance is much easier to see than teaching. Any observer can see it. You can even see it by watching a recording.  It exists, at least in part, outside of the course.  Teaching doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>This distinction seems obvious to me, and yet most people I talk to seem to confuse performance and teaching.  And that&#8217;s a problem.  If we reward and encourage performance, we may not actually be encouraging good teaching.  In fact, we may redirect effort away from it, toward things that don&#8217;t necessarily advance learning.  This isn&#8217;t a new problem, or an unfamiliar one.  Basically every text on teaching in higher education published in recent decades criticizes the lecture and the content-delivery emphasis it promotes.  But the emphasis on performance is a particular problem in this age of MOOCs.</p>
<p>MOOCs make performance even more visible, while hiding teaching further.  Now the performances are available to anyone in the world through online video, and directly viewed by tens of thousands of eyeballs in the course.  It&#8217;s easy to compare good performers and bad performers side-by-side.  And the pre-recorded lecture structure (with the dominant xMOOC approach) removes the interactivity that&#8217;s present even in most in-person &#8220;lecture&#8221; courses, as well as the distraction of sitting in a room with other students.  The MOOC experience is just you the student, and the instructor on stage.  And students can vote with their clicks to a greater extent than in a university setting, rewarding the brilliant performers with larger numbers.</p>
<p>None of this is necessarily a bad thing.  In many ways, it&#8217;s a very good thing.  To be clear, I&#8217;m a proponent of MOOCs.  I think they can provide tremendous potential benefits for education, in many contexts. And I&#8217;ve taught a large <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification">MOOC</a>, twice. In many ways that makes it easier for me to see the dangers they also create.  We need to view MOOCs as opportunities for experimentation, not magical solutions.  And among other things, we need to push back on our natural tendency to view their pedagogical effects purely from the standpoint of performance.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my personal problem.  I feel pretty confident that I&#8217;m good at performance.  I do a great deal of public speaking. I get plenty of positive feedback on my ability to convey concepts in an engaging way.  And my Gamification MOOC attracted a high number of students, very strong engagement/completion numbers, and great anecdotal responses.  All well and good.  In fact, those are things I&#8217;m proud of.  Yet they tell me little or nothing about how to teach effectively.  And the support resources I&#8217;ve found for improving teaching are really geared more toward improving performance.  I suspect that most university professors, having gone through PhD programs, are less comfortable with performance than teaching.  I&#8217;m the opposite.</p>
<p>Most of my teaching in my &#8220;day job&#8221; as a professor is in relatively small (20-70) classes, on topics that don&#8217;t emphasize mastery of formal concepts.  The students need to interact, and they need to apply knowledge.  I can&#8217;t get away with just performing.</p>
<p><strong>So here&#8217;s the question I keep coming back to: how do I judge success?</strong>  How can I figure out what&#8217;s good teaching, not just good performance?  Because until I can answer that question, I find it immensely difficult to feel any sense of satisfaction in what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>Good teaching means that students are learning.  But that&#8217;s just rephrasing the question.  How do I know if students are learning?  I can see how it might be possible to answer that question in subjects where there&#8217;s a well-developed, structured set of concepts that students need to master, generations of students have mastered, and instructors have seen students master time and again.  I don&#8217;t teach anything like that.  Any bar I set seems arbitrary: I&#8217;m just making up a target for students to hit.  It doesn&#8217;t tell me if I&#8217;m doing well or poorly as a teacher.</p>
<p>I think if I can develop a better answer to this question, it will make me more effective as both a classroom teacher and a MOOC instructor.  And it will help me understand where I can use the MOOC to enhance my in-person course on the same subject.  This is the benefit and the danger of the &#8220;flipped classroom&#8221; notion: it separates teaching and performance to a large extent.  If the students watch the performance on video at home the night before, what they experience the next day in the classroom had better be teaching.  <strong>That&#8217;s a scary thought.</strong></p>
<p><em>Am I looking at this the right way?  For those of you who teach, how do you decide what constitutes success in a course? What resources were helpful to you in answering that question?  </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was kind of in shock night.</p>
<p>Ten days ago, the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia summarily dumped the school&#8217;s popular president, Teresa Sullivan, based on mysterious &#8220;philosophical differences.&#8221;  The move threw the university into turmoil.  The Board refuses to disclose its reasons, so speculation is rampant.  Initial <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2012/06/teresa_sullivan_fired_from_uva_what_happens_when_universities_are_run_by_robber_barons_.html">reports</a> pointed to donors affiliated with Darden, UVa&#8217;s business school, who pushed for more &#8220;strategic dynamism&#8221; modeled on private businesses. Now, the Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper at the University of Virginia, has obtained internal Board emails through FOIA requests.  Several of them <a href="http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2012/jun/19/emails-reveal-desire-online-learning-strategy-ar-1999888/">made reference</a> to online education initiatives at competing universities.  The gist was that top-flight schools such as UVa &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/cavalierdaily/status/215229697078984704  ">need to have [online] strategies or will be left behind</a>,&#8221; and that massive-scale online courses offer a cost-reduction path out of the severe financial pressures facing many universities, especially public ones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in shock because I teach at a top business school (Wharton), and I&#8217;m soon leading a massive online open course (MOOC) on one of those new platforms (Coursera).  And what I&#8217;m hearing from the UVa cabal is an enormous misunderstanding of both business and technology.  Did we cause this?  If these accomplished, knowledgeable people could get things so very wrong, who else will do the same?</p>
<p>The point about business is pretty simple. The image of the visionary CEO who relentless turns the company on a dime to implement his (it&#8217;s inevitably a he) decisive leadership is a fantasy.  Yes, companies have bosses and hierarchies and management structures and salaries and performance reviews and all that&#8230; but do you really think everyone in a major enterprise jumps the moment the CEO gives a command?</p>
<p>I remember well a conversation I once had with the CEO of a Fortune 200 company going through difficult times. He and his leadership team understood exactly the market changes undermining their legacy business, and had a good turnaround strategy.  Yet he kept getting beaten up in the press for being clueless about what was happening.  The problem was going from vision and strategy to implementation by tens of thousands of employees used to the old ways.  And the more times a CEO goes to the well to promote dramatic changes, the harder it is to get employees to go along.</p>
<p>Sure, the best business leaders have vision, but they know they can&#8217;t implement it just by issuing edicts from the top.   There has to be a reservoir of trust, and a set of structures and incentives that work for the whole organization.  Corporate culture and capabilities also play an important role. Narcissistic leaders who fall in love with disruptive change for its own sake tend to kill the long-nurtured strengths that make great companies great.</p>
<p>These are hard lessons to appreciate.  That&#8217;s one reason (not the only one) that people pay so much to get MBAs at places like Wharton: to learn how to lead. If top universities can&#8217;t grok business because they aren&#8217;t businesses themselves, why do so many future corporate leaders compete so hard to spend two years there?  Think about it.</p>
<p>The point about technology is more subtle but has broader implications beyond higher education.</p>
<p>Stewart Brand had it right, some thirty years ago: information wants to be free&#8230;and also valuable.  Connected technology radically commoditizes and shares everything it can.  The price of anything reducible to software or hardware trends inexorably toward zero.  And yet, crucially, that makes the price of everything else trend toward infinity.  The sources of true differentiation, value, and human insight shrink as the means of spreading their influence grow.  And that magnifies their worth.  The process is like the death throes of a sun: exhaustion, followed by a catastrophic supernova radiating a shock wave across the vastness of space, leaving and immensely dense neutron star.  The output is both bigger and smaller than the input.</p>
<p>Consider a college course.  A random professor standing at the front of a lecture hall reading through slides is as much a legacy of artificial scarcities as waiting in a teller line before 3pm to make a bank withdrawal.  Duke professor and education innovator Cathy Davison is <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1680030/can-we-replace-professors-with-computer-screens">right</a> when she says that if professors aren&#8217;t doing better than computer screens, they should replace us.  But as Davidson emphasizes, the implication is not that face-to-face education will or should go away.  Ultimately, it realigns to focus on the things that computer screens can&#8217;t do.  To paraphrase Kevin Kelly, technology eventually gets <a href="http://www.kk.org/books/what-technology-wants.php">what technology wants</a>. And we get to be more human.  School becomes more about true learning and collaboration and less about rote knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying the process is easy or quick, or always bending toward improvement.  It&#8217;s ludicrous to take the few dozen free massively open online courses (MOOCs) available so far from elite universities or their faculty and say it&#8217;s game over for higher education as we know it.  None of these MOOCs give college credit, business models are uncertain, dropout rates are high, quality is uneven, and most of the offerings (mine included I&#8217;m sure) deviate only slightly from the structure of a traditional course.  They aren&#8217;t a threat to anyone in their current form.  They may fail utterly, like a previous generation of online university ventures (Fathom, Cardean) a decade ago.</p>
<p>Indeed, whomever is running UVa in ten years may take pride that the school didn&#8217;t go down the blind alley of MOOCs.  Who knows. Who cares? The MOOCs aren&#8217;t nearly as important as what they represent: massive scale of some aspects of knowledge dissemination, free flow of information, and rapid pedagogical experimentation.  These factors echo the reasons why businesses can, at least some of the time, out-innovate other kinds of organizations: they can go from small to big, they can fail, and their leaders can learn from experience.  A bit of that evolutionary pressure would indeed be helpful in education.  That&#8217;s very different from the caricatured image of business that seems to drive those now running UVa.</p>
<p>Back to why I&#8217;m in shock.  Personally, I&#8217;m teaching a MOOC for reasons that have nothing to do with saving money.  I want to be a disruptor rather than disrupted. Everyone in the world interested in what I&#8217;m teaching should have access to my courses.  There is a tremendous learning opportunity for faculty &#8212; and teaching is fundamentally about learning.  It will make the in-person courses I teach at Wharton better. And I just can&#8217;t conceive of a better way to get to the transformative version 2.0 and beyond than shipping the crappy 1.0 version.  But when I hear what I&#8217;m doing, and what my school teaches, invoked to justify conclusions I abhor, it shakes my confidence.  I hope what we&#8217;re hearing at UVa is a transient misunderstanding; I fear not.</p>
<p>Higher education is the increasingly rare field where the U.S. still leads the world, and it benefits all the world that sends us their students benefits.  Moreover, wherever it happens (and much of it emphatically won&#8217;t be in structured university programs) great education is absolutely vital to the advancement of humanity in the 21st century, along every dimension.  All the more important that understand correctly how business and technology can contribute.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a new petition posted on the White House&#8217;s &#8220;We The People&#8221; site, which calls for mandated public access to articles arising out of taxpayer-funded research.  Please go <a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl ">sign it</a>!</p>
<p>Your support could actually make a difference.  Petitions that receive 25,000 signatures will receive an official response from the White House.  More important, legislation requiring open access is currently stuck in Congress.  A significant response to this petition will demonstrate public support, which could make a difference in moving the bill forward.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s outrageous that today, when academics do research funded by government agencies such as the National Science Foundation, they are often legally prohibited by for-profit journal publishers from posting preprints of their work online. The research is only available to those who subscribe to the journals, which may cost thousands of dollars per year. If our tax dollars fund the research, why should we have to pay again to see the results?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see an argument against such a move.  Yet the small number of companies that dominate academic journal publishing have engaged in a fierce lobbying battle to preserve their artificial profit margins.  Scholarly journals still provide useful functions.  The reality is that &#8220;brand name&#8221; publications still matter for academic promotion and tenure.  In the age of the Internet, though, when publishing and distribution are virtually free, there&#8217;s no excuse for their high prices and access restrictions.  The National Institutes of Health adopted a rule a few years ago that required free public access to research it funded within one year of publication in a journal. For-profit journal publishers and the peer-review process they oversee didn&#8217;t collapse; they adapted just fine.  The proposed Congressional legislation would extend that rule to all other federal funding agencies.</p>
<p>Please take a few minutes to <a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl ">sign the petition</a> on the White House site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I get ready for my <a title="Coursera Gamification course" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gamification" target="_blank">massively open online course (MOOC) on gamification</a> this summer, I&#8217;ve been following discussions about MOOCs with great interest.  I think this new form of instruction may play a significant role in the transformation of universities in the coming decades.  First, though, we&#8217;ll need to overcome the confusion about what MOOCs are.</p>
<p>A MOOC is different than a traditional online course (offered to a limited group of enrolled students) and the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">open courseware</a> pioneered by universities such as MIT (disseminating course materials and recordings, but not an actual course).  A MOOC is massive and open, meaning that anyone around the world can join.  And massive means massive &#8212; some MOOCs have attracted over 100,000 students.  But the MOOC is still a course, meaning an interactive experience with assignments, discussion, and usually assessments.  It&#8217;s not just a recording or one-way broadcast of the &#8220;real&#8221; class.  Doing both of those things at once is extremely hard.  We&#8217;re at the earliest stages of figuring out how to do it, but there&#8217;s every reason to think the global Internet can support this new form of pedagogy.</p>
<p>Right now there are two main categories of MOOCs.  The first generation began three or four years ago, led by individual academics, with an emphasis on being open in every sense of the word.  MOOCs such as <a href="http://change.mooc.ca/">Change11</a> are based on a &#8220;connectivist&#8221; paradigm: learning comes from making connections. The course is a network with only a vaguely-defined curriculum, advancing through a web of participant chats, blog posts, tweets, and discussion forum posts.  The second-generation MOOCs, led by <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>, and <a href="http://www.edxonline.org/">EdX</a>, use a more traditional course structure, with a defined syllabus, tests, and certificates of completion. And though all three currently offer courses for free, they envision significant business opportunities in MOOCs.  Udacity and Coursera have venture capital funding, and EdX was seeded with $60 million from its partners, Harvard and MIT.  In time these two kinds of MOOCs may converge, but they&#8217;re trying to do subtly different things.</p>
<p>For me, the most important questions are how MOOCs might change higher education, and how they might change my own practice as a university professor.</p>
<p>The second is of most immediate interest.  I&#8217;m diving in to teach one of the first MOOCs partly because I see no better way to learn about how to do it effectively.  And I&#8217;m particularly excited about leveraging my learnings from the MOOC into my in-person courses here at Wharton.  I&#8217;m teaching three versions of my gamification course this year, including the MOOC, and they will all be different experiences.  A MOOC offers the infrastructure to &#8220;<a href="http://flippedlearning.org/">flip the class</a>&#8220;, so that students watch lectures at home on their own time, and use the classroom for interactive discussion and group work. Eventually I envision a continuum in which none of my courses are inherently &#8220;inside&#8221; or &#8220;outside&#8221; my university, but the dividing line is how I interact with students. In a successful MOOC, scale necessitates that students learn from each other.  That should happen on campus too, but it&#8217;s a different form of peer learning in-person and with an instructor to facilitate.</p>
<p>What about the broader impacts?  Will MOOCs really challenge the hegemony of universities?  Will they break the cycle of skyrocketing costs and declining outcomes that are beginning to raise concerns about the viability of the U.S. higher education system?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the confusion comes in.  The least revolutionary aspect of MOOCs is the price.  I see lots of discussion about how MOOCs will cut the cost of college.  This <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/05/06/cheaper-than-harvard-ivy-league-education-online-for-free.html" target="_blank">article from the Daily Beast</a> is typical.  Sure, there are so many students because the <a href="http://redeye.firstround.com/2007/03/the_first_penny.html">price is zero</a>.  But price has never been the barrier to online courses transforming higher education.  MIT has been posting is course materials online at a price of zero for a decade, and it&#8217;s just one example.  And even before the Internet, it was rarely difficult to audit university courses for free&#8230; as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">Steve Jobs did</a> after dropping out of Reed College.  So the fact that MOOCs make courses free isn&#8217;t a big deal in itself.  Even the possibility that MOOCs will offer course credit or a full online degree program at a fraction of the cost of a physical university isn&#8217;t unique: there are dozens of online colleges already in business with that same promise.  We still have ten students clamoring to pay the $56,000 Penn charges for tuition and housing for every one that we accept.</p>
<p>So is there anything truly revolutionary about MOOCs?  I think there is, at least potentially.</p>
<p>The key is to consider free education in the same light as Lawrence Lessig&#8217;s concept of <a href="http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/free_culture.lawrence_lessig/portrait.letter.pdf">Free Culture</a>.  To put more concretely, the open source software pioneer Richard Stahlman famously emphasized the distinction between free as in &#8220;free speech&#8221; and as in &#8220;free beer.&#8221;  MOOCs that are free in the beer sense are far less interesting than those free in the speech sense.  Real freedom means openness: to new ways of teaching, to new ways of learning, to radical sharing of the contents of a course, and to redefining both what counts as a course and how a course relates to a university education.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where technology come into play.  The connectivist MOOCs excel in using social media for a radically participatory, decentralized learning experience.  The commercial MOOCs, in addition to their potential for broad-scale marketing and partnerships, have the advantage in developing software infrastructure for things like automated grading, automated peer assessments, and learning analytics.  Both categories have revolutionary potential, although we&#8217;re a long way from realizing it.</p>
<p>The human dynamics are also favorable.  There are half a million people like me teaching college courses in the U.S.  Even a small percentage leading MOOCs will generate large numbers. And at a time of so much tumult in education, including universities, the big guns lining up behind MOOCs are bound to attract notice.  No one seeking to transform institutions should ignore the motivational power of fear and greed, even though those forces, once unleashed, can be difficult to control.  There are plenty of dangers amid the opportunities.</p>
<p>Again, all of this is in its infancy.  Just as many of us saw the potential of e-commerce in the mid-90s and social networking in the early 2000s, even though we couldn&#8217;t predict Google, Amazon, and Facebook, I&#8217;m far more confident about the significance of MOOCs than the particular trajectory they will take.  I&#8217;m looking forward to refining my perspective when I lead my MOOC this summer.</p>
