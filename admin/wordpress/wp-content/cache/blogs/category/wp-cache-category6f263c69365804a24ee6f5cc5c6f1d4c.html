				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have a tradition in my family of using Christmas Eve as an excuse for a hearty home-cooked family dinner, usually followed by making a fire in the fireplace and enjoying games or a movie together. Normally it&#8217;s my super-dense split pea soup, but this year I made that for Chanukah.  I made so much, in fact, that we were eating it for a week afterwards.  Time for something different.  So tonight, I&#8217;ll be doing stuffed cabbage (veggie for me, ground turkey for everyone else), and then we&#8217;ll move on to s&#8217;mores and Austin Powers.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not Christian, of course. Yet it feels somehow right to borrow what we appreciate from the cultural environment we live in.  As my <a href="http://mikeknopf.wordpress.com/about-rabbi-knopf/">Rabbi</a> points out, Jews have done that for thousands of years &#8212; the tzitzit or fringes on our prayer shawls were appropriated from Egyptian royalty.  The key, I think, is to borrow in a way that celebrates the best of both traditions. For most Americans, Christmas seems to be less about Jesus than shopping, but we can all agree on this as a time for family togetherness, as the year draws to a close.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll see how the stuffed cabbage comes out&#8230;.</p>
