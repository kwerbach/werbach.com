		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Kevin. I agree with you.  My simple parsing the net neutrality issue goes like this:

There are lots of people throwing around ideas of what they think Net
&gt; Neutrality is.  For some, it is a convenient hook for other unrelated concepts
&gt; like free speech and open source software.  For many, it is a crutch for
&gt; concepts like the &#039;gift economy&#039; (free as in free beer) or various
&gt; libertarian/neocon ideas (Esther Dyson stating in the WSJ that the Internet
&gt; has always been unregulated.)
&gt;
&gt;   Its obvious that
&gt; there is quite a bit of loose talk going on.
&gt;
&gt; I can offer what the term means in the world of law and policy, where it has
&gt; been adopted as a legal or policy regulatory regime.
&gt;
&gt; Net Neutrality is short for &quot;Network Neutrality&quot;.  It is a term that is
&gt; intended to apply to all networks, not just the Internet.  Network Neutrality
&gt; means that ALL networks must be operated on neutrality principles.  Cable,
&gt; satellite, telecom, data, leased data, video, etc.
&gt;
&gt; There are three neutrality principles.  They are 1) non-discrimination, 2)
&gt; interconnection, and 3) access.
&gt;
&gt; 1) Non-discrimination means that all bits are treated the same by the network
&gt; operator, including its own bits (bit parity).  In the convergent environment
&gt; all data is &#039;just bits.&#039;The network operator cannot discriminate against (or
&gt; in favor of) any bits/content/traffic over the network, except as required to
&gt; protect the security and quality of the network.  For example, a network
&gt; operator could, if it was possible, filter out DOS attacks, computer viruses,
&gt; or spam.
&gt;
&gt; This is simplistic, but that&#039;s my purpose.  I wanted to give a very concise
&gt; definition.  Obviously there are examples that challenge the paradigm (SIP,
&gt; SPAM), but the principle remains the same.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Interconnection means that any network can connect to any other network and
&gt; move traffic over and between the two networks, at reasonable
&gt; non-discriminatory rates.  Without interconnection there is no neutrality,
&gt; because there is no network.  There must be a &#039;right of interconnection&#039; so
&gt; that a network operator knows that it can get its traffic carried on rival
&gt; networks.
&gt;
&gt; Neutrality means nothing if there is no way to know that you can send traffic
&gt; to end users that terminate on another network.  For example, someone sending
&gt; traffic on a telecom network must be able to know that they can send traffic
&gt; to an end user on the cable operator&#039;s network.
&gt;
&gt; This resembles common carriage.  It would make every network operator very
&gt; similar to a common carrier as to the network operations, only.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Access means that any end user can send traffic to any other end user,
&gt; without discrimination or interference.  Don&#039;t worry about the
&gt; non-discrimination stuff right now.  The important principle is being able to
&gt; reach an end user, emphasis on the &#039;end&#039;.  This is a consumer-oriented
&gt; restatement of Prof. Lessig&#039;s &#039;end-to-end&#039; principle.
&gt;
&gt; End users could be individuals, but they are also devices and even other
&gt; networks.  For example, a modem must be able to speak with another device at
&gt; the other end of the network.  An individual must be able to email to another
&gt; individual on another network, but it also applies to voice, video, or files.
&gt; Access also applies to video networks (at reasonable fees), telecom (for
&gt; competition in local and long distance and for services like voicemail, for
&gt; instance), and data (so that any router or modem can be attached, like a wi-fi
&gt; router).
&gt;
&gt; That&#039;s all there is to network neutrality. We can discuss how to present this
&gt; definition, but this is the actual, real-world, working definition that has
&gt; been enacted into law in the other developed countries.
