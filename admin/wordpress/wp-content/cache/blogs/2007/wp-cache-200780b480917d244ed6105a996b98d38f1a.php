		<description><![CDATA[(This is actually a comment from Harold Feld, who is having trouble authenticating with the blog.)
&lt;p&gt;
To Greg Rosston: &lt;i&gt;Beware the incomplete assertion.&lt;/i&gt;
I most certainly agree!  For example, I addressed the very point you raised in my blog entry.
&lt;blockquote&gt;What does this do to the universe. Well, no surprise, G &amp; Y are worse off in scenario &quot;D&quot; (both pay). G is better off in Scenario &quot;C&quot; (G only pays) because it uses the premium treatment to capture more customers. Y, of course, is much worse off, as are customers that value Y over G. But customers that value G over Y or are indifferent to G over Y experience a &quot;consumer surplus,&quot; because G is available faster at no additional cost to the customer.

This doesn&#039;t help &quot;competition&quot; mind, and in reality means that the non-premium services are marginalized (as predicted). But, under the terms of the theoretic game, this is a &quot;consumer welfare surplus&quot; because more people (those that prefer G or are indifferent) are better off under the terms of the game. I expect this to be another point that anti-NN folks seek to use to foster confusion by applying the term &quot;consumer welfare&quot; outside the very narrow context of the specified game. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Dr. Rosston is certainly entitled to disagree with my assessment, he can hardly claim that I failed to address it (or am I the only one who reads more than the abstract these days?).  In any event, I must ask Dr. Rosston if he believes this is what policymakers think &quot;consumer surplus&quot; means?  I also must ask if he himself believes that a consumer surplus of this nature justifies permitting discrimination, assuming the other assumptions of the paper hold?&lt;/p&gt;]]></description>
