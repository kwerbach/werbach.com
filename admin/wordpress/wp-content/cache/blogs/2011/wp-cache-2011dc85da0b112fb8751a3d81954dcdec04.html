		<description><![CDATA[Networks are neither fully centralized nor fully decentalized; they&#039;re more like &quot;multiply centralized&quot; around switches and routers. Netheads have never really understood this, and as a result the Internet has never been any more decentralized than the global telephone network. In both cases, independent networks interoperate with other on their own terms.

The language for articulating what&#039;s unique about the Internet has never been very accurate, in other words. 

Open Flow is a virtual network underneath the Internet, which is a virtual network itself. From my POV, Open Flow is the first system to grasp the fact that the virtual network thing has been the essence of the Internet all along; all this end-to-end malarkey is just one blind man&#039;s theory of the elephant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just as an FYI, it is entirely conceivable that everyone who runs an AS would have their own &#039;centralized&#039; OpenFlow controller, which as far as I can tell still satisfies the definition of &#039;de-centralized intelligence&#039;.  I&#039;m not sure anyone as this point is arguing for a centralized controller for the entire internet.]]></description>
