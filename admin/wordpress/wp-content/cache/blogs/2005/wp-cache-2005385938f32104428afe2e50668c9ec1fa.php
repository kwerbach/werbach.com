		<description><![CDATA[You have probably realised this by now, but mozilla never intended mac OSX users to use firefox. It is dire on the mac platform. HOWEVER and a big one, they created a browser which is based on firefox code, designed from scratch for the mac. It is called camino, and can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.caminobrowser.org/&lt;/a&gt;

I use camino all the time; it is awesome. Another browser for the mac to try is shiira; similar to safari but with much more customizability, and with some extra very useful features. It has one problem, which may not affect you. If you use macromedia fireworks, and have shiira set as your default browser; fireworks has trouble recognising it. But that s extremely minor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the responses guys.  The speed issue isn&#039;t just Firefox; it&#039;s pretty much universal.  For example, most of the time I click on the Apple menu it takes a second or two to drop down, which is just   plain annoying.

And if Firefox, which I use all the time, sucks on the Mac, that&#039;s another strike against the platform.  Safari doesn&#039;t have all the extensions I use, and it means changing my browsing habits at a minimum.  The program I use even more than Firefox -- Eudora for email -- also seems worse on the Mac than on Windows, in various small annoying ways.  I finally got all the mailboxes moved over, so at least I can now use the Mac as my primary machine.

The trash can isn&#039;t a big thing, but I wish Apple would leave the choice to me.  In quickly scanning the line of icons in the dock, it&#039;s not obvious which one is that trash can, which makes it take slightly longer to find it.

In general, though, I guess my problem is that I&#039;m not seeing the big advantages I expected from the switch.  I&#039;ve had two crashes so far that required removing the battery to restart (holding down the power key didn&#039;t seem to shut down the machine), and about the same frequency of force quits I had with WinXP (one or two a day).  Wireless support seems worse than my Thinkpad -- the Powerbook doesn&#039;t recognize my Linksys access point -- and apparently I&#039;m doomed to having problems with my 6 or 7 USB hard drives and keychains, because Macs don&#039;t like them.  Print to PDF comes with Acrobat 7, which I own on both platforms, so that doesn&#039;t feel like a Mac advantage, and I have yet to find a real use for the Dashboard.  Spotlight sounds nice in theory, although the vast majority of what I search through is email messages, which I can do already in Eudora.

I wish I wasn&#039;t so cranky, but given that I was a die-hard Mac user for a decade, and everything good I&#039;ve heard about OS X, I&#039;m really surprised I&#039;m not having a better experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Respectfully, I think your dissatisfaction with Firefox is a problem with Firefox, not your Mac. The Mac version of Firefox is a spectacularly crappy program. Ditch it and use Safari instead. You&#039;ll be much happier.

(For the record, the reason PowerBooks are slower than Power Macs has nothing to do with the CPU. It&#039;s principally the hard drive that does it.)

No, there is no way to move the trash can out of the dock. You also don&#039;t have to use the context menu. You can just drag things to the trash can, just like you always did.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kevin,

I switched last year, and I&#039;m much happier with the Mac, especially for things like the wireless network support as well as the instant on from sleep.

Wrt your comment about the speed- I agree.  The Macs ought to be faster and I think that&#039;s one of the key reasons Jobs switched to Intel.

Wrt moving mail, you might want to try Eudora Mailbox Cleaner.

Wrt the trash can placement, I guess it&#039;s a matter of perspective.  I think long-time Mac users (well, at least long-time OS X users) understand that the trash is on the Dock.  Moving it off the Dock may be possible, but in general I think Mac users want their experience to be different than Windows, rather than similar to.

It&#039;s not perfect, but I think that things like Spotlight, Dashboard, excellent wireless support, Print-to-PDF from any browser (I LOVE THIS FEATURE) the Mac is easily my preferred platform (and this is after almost a decade on Windows starting with Win95.]]></description>
