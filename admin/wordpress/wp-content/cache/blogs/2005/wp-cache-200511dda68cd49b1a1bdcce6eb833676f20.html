		<description><![CDATA[Since you know FCC procedure can you please comment on this situation:

Vonage has filed a complaint with FCC, but neither they nor FCC describe fully the nature of the complaint. The only thing that is known is it is not an ILEC, but a rural provider. Is it normal for making some information public, but not full information while the investigation is ongoing? Can we get a copy of the complaint under freedom of information act?

Thanks
