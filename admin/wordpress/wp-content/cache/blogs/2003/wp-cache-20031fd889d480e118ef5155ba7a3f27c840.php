		<description><![CDATA[I have used Palm for a long time.  My enitre marketing databse is on palm, a true life saver at a trade show (but that anouther story).

A few negative obervations:
1. No address, note pad and a few other primary icons.  Don&#039;t understand why they didn&#039;t put them in.  Wouldn&#039;t be that hard!

2. No pop up grafiti area.  I agree the keyboard works very well to my surprise but a screen write or something wouldn&#039;t have been hard to put in.

3.  A biggie, no glass screen.  I would of gladly taken the extra weight for the durability.  Everything feels and looks VERY solid.  Thought it was cheap not to put it on when you pay the big dollars for it.

Positive comments:
1. Thankly they didn&#039;t put in a higher res screen.  My girlffriend has a Tungten E.  It has a better screen but it SUCKS the power.  Screen is a higher res than my now old m515.  Nice as my database screen still hold the same number of record lines.

2. Use aps while on the phone, switch to speaker phone and talk at the same time.  Bliss with my applications.

3. Camera, I have been told with regular camera phones you can&#039;t download the images to your pc without signing up on the picture plan.  Doesn&#039;t seem worth the money for me.  Treo 600 automatically downloads the images to your pc.  Very cool.

4. Acts like a flash drive when connected to your computer.  Get a big memory card and throw away your flash usb memory.  A great selling feature I did not know it had till I brought it home.

Final comments:

Glad I waited till now to buy a plam phone.  Everything I dreamed about and more.  I do not use a data plan for surfin the net.  Text messaging is fine alternative for the money.  I use the database more than anything.

Exceeded my expectations.  If you use your palm and cell allot buy a treo 600.  You will love it.]]></description>
