				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.diepunyhumans.com/archives/006847.html">Cory Doctorow</a>: &#8220;<span class="rss:item">The last twenty years were about technology. The next twenty years are about policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A nice formulation, but, with all due respect, a wrong one.&nbsp;<br />
Technology and policy are always intertwined.&nbsp; Both of them always<br />
matter.&nbsp; Was the Napster saga &#8220;about&#8221; peer-to-peer technology, or<br />
the current state of copyright law and the music industry?&nbsp; Was<br />
the rapid growth of the commercial Internet in the US &#8220;about&#8221; advances<br />
in data networking or enlightened FCC policies?&nbsp; The danger lies<br />
in thinking about either element in a vacuum.&nbsp; Geeks and the<br />
technology industry love to think they can ignore policy battles, which<br />
is just as misguided as policy-makers thinking they can adopt laws<br />
without regard to technological reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Policy&#8221; here has several meanings.&nbsp; It includes not only laws and<br />
regulations, but the subtler policies imposed by private organizations<br />
and software <a href="http://www.lessig.org">code</a>.&nbsp; For<br />
example, social networking services will succeed or fail based on how<br />
well their policies map to latent user expectations, not just their<br />
technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m finishing up a fascinating (albeit overly verbose) book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393020010/qid=1072187603/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-6280091-5069665?v=glance&amp;s=books">Einstein&#8217;s Clocks, Poincare&#8217;s Maps: Empires of Time</a>,<br />
by Peter Galiston, that illustrates this point in a completely<br />
different context.&nbsp; The book situates Albert Einstein&#8217;s theory of<br />
special relativity within the 19th-century effort to fix longitude and<br />
simultaneous time between distant clocks.&nbsp; Relativity was not just<br />
a theory of physics; it had deep roots in both metaphysical philosophy<br />
and practical engineering.&nbsp; Einstein succeeded because he was able<br />
to join these worlds without being overly nostalgic about any of<br />
them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cory is right about one thing.&nbsp; Policy battles will be crucial to<br />
the future of the technology industry over the next twenty years.&nbsp;<br />
If these battles are to be resolved productively, we need to keep<br />
pushing both sides to acknowledge the significance of the other.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Qwest CEO Dick Notebaert comes out in support of treating voice over IP as a largely unregulated &#8220;information service&#8221; in a <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/op-ed/20031216-090337-5664r.htm">Washington Times op-ed</a>.&nbsp;<br />
Qwest is unique among the incumbent local phone giants, since it has a<br />
large Internet backbone and business services operation.&nbsp; Still,<br />
it&#8217;s good to see a telco CEO reject applying legacy regulation to<br />
VOIP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one point Notebaert&#8217;s op-ed doesn&#8217;t squarely address is whether<br />
VOIP should be subject to the inflated &#8220;access charges&#8221; that companies<br />
like Qwest charge to originate or terminate telephone traffic.&nbsp;<br />
The implication of classing VOIP as an information service is that<br />
access charges should not apply, and that&#8217;s the right result.&nbsp; </p>
