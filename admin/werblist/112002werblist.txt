I'm busy these days with final preparations for Supernova, which is 
coming up in less than three weeks.  It's going to be a fantastic 
event -- see http://www.pulver.com/supernova/ for details.  

This month, a piece I wrote for Slate.com about how spam will change 
email, and an essay on why both sides of the broadband content debate 
are wrong.  Plus interesting links I've recently come across.

Werblist is an evolving experiment.  I welcome your feedback at 
kevin@werbach.com.

DEATH BY SPAM
The e-mail you know and love is about to vanish

(Originally published November 18, 2002 in Slate)


One-third of the 30 billion e-mails sent worldwide each day are spam. 
That's 10 billion daily pitches for herbal Viagra, Nigerian scams, and 
genital-enlarging creams piling up in our inboxes. Neither legislation 
nor litigation against spammers has stemmed the tide, and they're not 
going to have much of an effect in the future, either. It's time to 
give up: Despite the best efforts of legislators, lawyers, and 
computer programmers, spam has won. Spam is killing e-mail.

Or at least it's about to destroy the e-mail we're used to: the tool 
that lets a stranger respond to something you posted on your Web site 
or that lets a potential client contact you after reading an article 
you wrote. E-mail is pervasive because it's simple to use, remarkably 
flexible, and it reaches everyone. The trouble is that e-mail is too 
good at that third task. Because e-mail inboxes are open to anyone, 
longtime Internet users now receive hundreds of spams per day, making 
e-mail virtually unusable without countermeasures.

The most common countermeasure, server-side filtering, has serious 
limitations. No automated system can identify spam as well as a human 
can. Internet service providers certainly try: They block known 
spammer addresses and use algorithms to identify spam based on an e-
mail's contents, subject line, or other headers. AOL and MSN both 
trumpet spam filtering systems like this in their latest software, and 
Yahoo! and Microsoft's Hotmail offer junk-mail filters for their Web-
based e-mail services. But the filters are running out of gas. The 
spammers keep multiplying, and they keep finding clever ways to fool 
the systems designed to stop them. Promising newcomers such as 
CloudMark, which taps the collective power of e-mail recipients to 
identify spam, may improve things for a while. But there will always 
be a trade-off between catching all the spam and ensuring that every 
piece of legitimate e-mail gets through.

So, sophisticated Internet users are turning to a new approach. 
Instead of trying to block spam while allowing everything else, these 
users employ software that blocks everything except messages from 
already known, accepted senders. These systems, called "whitelists," 
change e-mail from an open system to a closed one.

Whitelist applications available today include MailFrontier, 
ChoiceMail from DigiPortal, Vanquish, and the freeware Tagged Message 
Delivery Agent. There's also a whitelist option built into Hotmail, 
known as the "exclusive" setting. Though it's hidden in the 
preferences menu (click "Options," then "Junk Mail Filter"), more than 
10 percent of Hotmail users reportedly invoke it. Before long, expect 
all e-mail applications to offer this function.

Whitelists typically allow e-mail from everyone in a user's existing 
address book. Other, unknown senders receive an automated reply, 
asking them to take further action, such as explain who they are. Or 
senders may be asked to identify a partially obscured image of a word. 
A person can make out the word, but automated spammer software can't.

Whitelists are rare today, but they will become more common. The 
relentless growth of spam guarantees it. A filter that catches 80 
percent of spam sounds great, and it is great if you get 10 spams a 
day. But when you get 500 a day, that same filter leaves you sorting 
through 100 opportunities to Make Money Fast!!!!!

Like it or not, the only way to kill spam is for an element of e-mail 
to die as well. There's always been something charming and casual 
about e-mail. The informality comes through in the style people use to 
write messages, but also in where they send them. You've probably sent 
an e-mail to someone you'd never call on the phone, approach in 
person, or even write a letter to. Losing this aspect of e-mail is a 
shame, but it's inevitable. E-mail will become more like instant 
messaging, with its defined "buddy lists."

E-mail's openness is doomed when faced with massive traffic and a few 
bad actors. The next time you try to reach out and touch someone 
electronically, you may need to know who that person is. Otherwise, 
you might be reaching out to no one.

*SUPERNOVA 2002*: December 9-10 in Palo Alto, CA

Time is running out to register for Supernova!

http://www.pulver.com/supernova/

We've added legendary Lotus founder Mitch Kapor to a speaker roster 
that already included Google's Sergey Brin, P2P thinker Clay Shirky, 
Microsoft's Dan'l Lewin, visionary Howard Rheingold, IBM's Rod Smith, 
and telecom provocateur David Isenberg.  Supernova will be the first 
public presentation of Chandler, Kapor's audacious plan to turn 
productivity software upside down.  

Supernova is the only place you'll learn how WiFi, collaborative 
software, Weblogs, broadband media, and Web services may undermine 
your business... or create powerful growth opportunities.  Some of the 
smartest and most successful people in tech are coming for a blast of 
fresh thinking and useful insights.  Can you afford to miss it?

The Broadband Content Myth

The idea that solving the digital copyright mess is crucial to 
broadband adoption has become conventional wisdom. I first saw this 
argument in a column by law professor Lawrence Lessig in the Industry 
Standard. He used it to point the finger of blame at the content 
owners. Yet the content owners use the same argument!  They blame the 
greedy technology industry for balking at the digital rights 
management technologies that will usher in movies on demand.

Both sides are mistaken. Digital entertainment will be a big part of 
the broadband market, but we should be skeptical any time someone 
tells us they can foresee a "killer app". Video on demand is actually 
a hoary example of an app that didn't kill, despite lavish funding and 
high expectations. It was the centerpiece of the hyped video dialtone 
networks of the 1990s, remember? You probably don't. That's the point.

Real killer apps tend to surprise people. No one in the early 1990s 
thought that interoperable email would be the driver of the Internet 
boom. And who would have predicted that the most successful of the 
countless Internet startups was the one that made it easy for people 
to swap Pez dispensers? eBay looks obvious only in hindsight.

Broadband isn't an application; it's a platform. No magic bullet will 
suddently convince everyone to adopt it. That's also the fallacy of 
legislation such as the Tauzin-Dingell bill that pretends one legal 
change, whether deregulating the incumbent phone companies or 
regulating them more, will transform the market overnight. Sure, we 
can do things that will speed up or slow down broadband. The 
difference matters to investors and to companies. It's dangerous, 
though, to set up a straw-man broadband nirvana and fight an all-or-
nothing battle about it.

There will indeed be killer apps on broadband platforms. However, I 
suspect multiplayer gaming, personal videoblogging, voice telephony 
and on-demand do-it-yourself and personal-improvement videos will rank 
far above downloadable movies on the list.

Don't get me wrong. By insisting on extreme restrictions on content, 
the copyright holders, especially in the movie industry, have done a 
disservice to their customers and to the economy. There's a middle 
ground that addresses realistic concerns about piracy, while not 
throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I personally think the 
content owners' intransigence is the primary reason we haven't gotten 
there. Yet both sides are guilty of ratcheting up the doomsday 
rhetoric instead of negotiating. And that's why the "killer app" 
question matters.

If you think your opponents are the only thing standing in the way of 
immediate ubiquitous broadband, you're going to fight tooth-and-nail 
for your point of view. If you have a healthy humility about your 
ability to foresee killer apps, you'll do what the founding Internet 
technologists did. They built a network on the principle of end-to-
end, meaning that the network didn't pre-suppose the applications. 
Now, more than ever, we should adhere to that approach.
