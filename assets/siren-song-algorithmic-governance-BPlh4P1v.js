summary: "This chapter critically examines the allure and limitations of blockchain-based algorithmic governance, arguing that while distributed ledgers offer novel coordination mechanisms, they cannot replace human judgment and democratic institutions in complex governance scenarios. The analysis reveals how blockchain's technical features both enable and constrain governance possibilities."

## Abstract

Blockchain technology has inspired visions of algorithmic governance—systems where code replaces traditional human institutions in making collective decisions and managing shared resources. Proponents argue that blockchain's transparency, immutability, and decentralization can create governance that is more efficient, democratic, and resistant to corruption than conventional institutions. From decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to blockchain-based voting systems and tokenized governance mechanisms, numerous projects pursue this vision of governance without governors.

This chapter examines the siren song of algorithmic governance: an attractive promise that may lead to dangerous shores. Through analysis of prominent blockchain governance experiments, including The DAO hack, on-chain governance systems, and token-based decision-making, it reveals persistent challenges that code alone cannot overcome.

The analysis identifies **four fundamental limitations**: (1) **The articulation problem** - reducing complex governance questions to binary code decisions inevitably loses nuance and context; (2) **The participation problem** - token-based governance concentrates power among wealthy stakeholders rather than distributing it democratically; (3) **The evolution problem** - immutable code struggles to adapt to changing circumstances and unforeseen challenges; and (4) **The plutocracy problem** - economic voting rights tend toward oligarchic rather than democratic outcomes.

Drawing on political philosophy, organizational theory, and empirical evidence from blockchain projects, the chapter argues that effective governance requires capabilities blockchain cannot provide: interpretation of ambiguous situations, weighing of incommensurable values, accommodation of minority interests, and institutional legitimacy. Algorithmic mechanisms work best as complements to, not replacements for, human judgment and democratic institutions.

The chapter concludes by outlining principles for blockchain governance that acknowledges these limitations: maintaining human override mechanisms, ensuring governance adaptability, protecting against wealth concentration, and recognizing that decentralization is a means to governance goals, not an end in itself. Understanding blockchain's governance limitations is essential for harnessing its genuine benefits without succumbing to technological determinism.
