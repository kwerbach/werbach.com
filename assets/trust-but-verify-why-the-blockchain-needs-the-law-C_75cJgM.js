## Abstract

Blockchain technology promises to replace trust with cryptographic verification, enabling transactions and governance without intermediaries. Proponents claim blockchain can transcend law, creating autonomous systems that operate independently of legal frameworks. However, this paper demonstrates that blockchain systems remain deeply dependent on legal institutions for their effectiveness and legitimacy.

The analysis explores three fundamental ways law remains essential: (1) **Smart contract governance** - even immutable code requires legal interpretation for gaps, errors, and unforeseen circumstances; (2) **Dispute resolution** - conflicts inevitably arise that blockchain's technical mechanisms cannot adjudicate; and (3) **Interface with traditional systems** - blockchain must connect with existing legal, financial, and regulatory structures.

Through examination of specific use cases including digital currencies, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and blockchain-based property registries, the paper reveals the limitations of purely technological trust mechanisms. Legal frameworks provide crucial functions that code alone cannot replicate: establishing property rights, enforcing contracts when technical mechanisms fail, protecting vulnerable parties, and providing mechanisms for upgrading and adapting systems over time.

The paper argues for a complementary relationship between blockchain and law, where each reinforces the other. Blockchain can enhance legal transparency, automate enforcement, and reduce transaction costs, while law provides the flexibility, legitimacy, and ultimate backstop that pure code lacks. Understanding this symbiotic relationship is essential for realizing blockchain's transformative potential while avoiding the pitfalls of technological utopianism.
