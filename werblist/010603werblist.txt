Happy 2003!  I didn't put out an issue of Werblist last month because 
I was busy running, and then recovering from, my Supernova conference 
(http://www.pulver.com/supernova).  As noted below, the conference was 
a great success.  I'm energized for the next one, and for everything 
in the year to come.  I hope you are too.

PARTY LIKE IT'S 1995
The commercial Web in 2003 is getting back to what worked years ago

(Originally published January 2, 2003 in Slate)

Way back in the mid-1990s, search was one of the Internet's primary 
battlefields. AltaVista, spun out of high-end computer vendor Digital 
Equipment Corporation, competed with Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite to 
offer the biggest search-engine database and the most accurate 
results. Yahoo!, which had the most Internet users thanks to its deep 
subject-oriented directory of Web sites, chose not to develop its own 
search engine. Instead, it licensed technology from a startup, 
Inktomi. Yahoo! believed that its transcendent brand and a growing 
array of services and content-rather than a lowly search engine-would 
allow it to remain the starting point for most Internet users.

So, although Yahoo!'s original claim to fame was helping Internet 
users find Web sites and other online resources, it allowed Google to 
become the king of that function today. Big mistake. Search engines 
have re-emerged as critical assets for Web-based businesses. In a 
belated effort to regain search supremacy, Yahoo! just plunked down 
$235 million in cash to buy its old friend Inktomi.

Yahoo!'s saga is a microcosm of the entire Internet industry. Today, 
as companies retreat to their core businesses, they are finding, to 
their horror, that nimbler competitors have occupied the ground they 
neglected. Through the heady days of the dot.com boom, Yahoo! and 
other leading Web-based businesses larded on feature after feature, 
including stock quotes, Web-based e-mail, shopping, calendars, 
streaming audio and video, chat, instant messaging, and games-anything 
to increase traffic and therefore revenues. Companies that were once 
simply "search engines" fattened themselves into "portals." Yahoo!'s 
Web directory, its original raison d'être, became an afterthought.

But as it turns out, the one thing people really want to do online is 
find things. A Pew Foundation study last month found that more than 60 
percent of Americans expect they can locate information online about 
government resources, news, health care, and business products and 
services. That's among all Americans. For those online, the numbers 
surpass 80 percent. The Web has become so enormous that it's a virtual 
certainty the answer you're looking for is out there; the hard part is 
locating it.

Google, launched in 1998, came on the scene too late to join the 
portal wars. It put all its energy toward one goal: being the best at 
search. While Yahoo! slept, Google quietly became the dominant 
Internet search engine, handling one-half of all searches. With its 
Day-Glo logo, grad-student founders, and offices featuring a masseuse 
and a professional chef, Google is a caricature of the bubble-era 
dot.com startup. With one difference: It's profitable. It's now the 
fourth most popular destination on the Internet, trailing only 
Microsoft/MSN (which publishes Slate), Yahoo!, and AOL Time Warner. 
For many users, Google is the Web, in the way that AOL and Netscape 
once were. It's the primary interface they use to maneuver online.

Buying Inktomi is Yahoo!'s last, best hope to reassert itself as a 
starting point for users. But it's too late. Yahoo! is still trying to 
be all things to all people. Google succeeds because it concentrates 
exclusively on search. It's no accident that the other profitable 
search company, Overture, maintains a similar focus. Overture's secret 
is that it sells its listings to the highest bidder, much the way 
companies can pay for bigger listings in the Yellow Pages.

The Net has come full circle. The enduring startups fall into the 
categories that led the market in the early commercial days of 1995-
1996: search engines (Google and Overture), business-to-consumer e-
commerce (Amazon and eBay), and infrastructure software for business 
(BEA Systems and VeriSign). Meanwhile, the landscape is littered with 
the carcasses of companies, from incubator CMGI to Excite@Home, that 
convinced themselves that more was always better. Like Yahoo!, 
Inktomi's story follows the script: Instead of extending its early 
lead in search, it jumped into unrelated businesses such as content 
distribution. As a result, Yahoo! abandoned Inktomi for another search 
technology vendor -- none other than Google. When the bubble burst, 
Inktomi was forced to scale back through layoffs and asset sales.

The Googles of the world, who found valuable niches and stuck to their 
knitting, are thriving. Yahoo! and Inktomi find themselves the 
equivalent of a 1970s conglomerate: The whole is worth less than the 
parts. It doesn't take a search engine to figure that out.

SUPERNOVA 2002 NOTES

On December 9-10, 2002, over 120 technology industry leaders gathered 
at the Supernova conference in Palo Alto, CA to discuss the impacts of 
decentralizing technologies such as Web services, WiFi, Weblogs, and 
broadband media.  Supernova is a joint production of Kevin Werbach and 
pulver.com.  It focuses on the distributed future of software, 
communications, and media.

Supernova 2002 was perhaps the most interactive conference ever. In 
addition to the lively audience participation, dozens of attendees 
posted to the Web and commented live through the on-site wireless 
network.  We ran two Weblogs, both heavily used: an "official" 
conference report (http://www.pulver.com/supernova/weblog.html) and a 
collaborative group blog (http://192.246.69.113/group.html).  

The atmosphere was electric.  Discussions ranged from the social 
consequences of pervasive wireless connectivity to the impact of the 
Internet on journalism to the potential of new residential broadband 
technologies.  A few highlights:

*	Lotus founder Mitch Kapor giving his first public presentation 
about Chandler, his new open source interpersonal information manager.  

*	Microsoft's top Silicon Valley executive Dan'l Lewin gamely 
taking on audience members who challenged the openness of Microsoft's 
.Net strategy.  

*	Cap Gemini Ernst & Young CTO John Parkinson's bold proclamation 
that after spending a billion dollars on collaboration software, he 
hadn't seen anything that worked.  

*	Google co-founder Sergey Brin agreeing to consider a new 
mechanism, suggested by a conference participant, for updating Weblog 
pages in Google's index.  

Given how difficult a market it is for conferences, it was a 
tremendous beginning.  Now the challenge is to do even better.  I'm 
pleased to announce that Supernova 2003 will be held in mid-June in 
the Washington, DC area.  Mark your calendars!
