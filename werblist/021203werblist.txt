As you probably know, one of my projects is a conference called
Supernova <http://www.pulver.com/supernova> about the decentralization
of software, communications, and media. I'm in the process of planning
Supernova 2003, which is scheduled for July 8-9 in Washington, DC.

I've established a new email list, The Supernova Report, for my essays
and links on topics related to decentralization.  I'll continue to use
the list you're reading now to distribute my published columns,
personal notes, and thoughts on other topics.  You can sign up for the
Supernova Report at <http://www.pulver.com/supernova/subscribe.html>.

AOL KNOCKED OUT?
'Synergy' Became 'Convergence' Became a Broken Dream

(Originally published January 19, 2003 in the Philadelphia Inquirer)


Almost exactly two years ago, AOL CEO Steve Case and Time Warner CEO
Gerald Levin announced the biggest corporate merger in history.  Yet
on that January day, something was amiss: the way the two men were
dressed.  Levin, the corporate titan and former lawyer, wore an open-
collared shirt.  Case, the boyish Internet entrepreneur and Hawaii
native, was attired in a blue banker’s suit and gold tie.

It was a fitting metaphor for AOL Time Warner, an agglomeration of two
companies trying to be something they weren't.  Like Tom Hanks in the
movie Big, AOL saw the acquisition as a short-cut to growing up.  Time
Warner thought it had found the fountain of youth.  Neither got its
wish.  AOL Time Warner has lost more than 60 percent of its value
since the merger, and AOL’s online service, the supposed engine of
growth, has struggled financially.  Levin resigned in late 2001, and
AOL’s Bob Pittman, a key architect of the deal, left last year.
Case’s announcement that he would step down as chairman provides a
certain closure.

In hindsight, AOL Time Warner was born out of one dumb strategy and
one smart one.  The first idea is "synergy," and its failing are
becoming apparent.   The wisdom of the second insight may some day be
appreciated.  If so, credit should go to its architect: Steve Case.

Synergy came into vogue in the media world in the 1980s.  Companies
rushed to combine content assets such as movie studios and record
labels with distribution channels such as cable TV infrastructure.  As
digital technologies emerged, synergy turned into "convergence," a
vision of one network delivering every product and service imaginable.
The poster child was the first great media conglomerate, none other
than Time Warner.  Though some cost savings and cross-marketing
opportunities proved out, no one noticed that the most advanced
examples of convergence, including Time Warner’s Full Service Network
and local phone companies’ forays into video programming, were abject
failures.

The AOL Time Warner merger made convergence an end in itself.  Alas,
reality was no match for the hype.  Synergy in practice meant mundane
efforts such as selling subscriptions to Fortune and Sports
Illustrated via AOL pop-up ads.  When it came to big opportunities
straddling old and new media, such as digital music delivery, AOL Time
Warner fared no better -- and sometimes worse -- coordinating its
fractious internal divisions than competitors did negotiating between
companies.

Convergence is a technical reality.  Today’s digital networks can
deliver voice, video, music, and data across an array of devices.
That doesn't mean that combining businesses across the digital divide
will make one suddenly sexy and the other suddenly respectable.
Furthermore, the AOL Time Warner merger assumed that combining content
and distribution would produce an unbreakable hold on customers.  That
doesn't work on the open Internet, as AOL should know.  AOL became the
dominant online service despite owning neither the phone lines it rode
on nor much of the content it distributed.  It simply had the best
user experience and the best community.

Which leads to the smart reason for the merger: AOL is worth
something.  Wall Street is effectively valuing the online service at
zero, despite its tens of millions of members and millions in annual
profits.  AOL’s troubles derive from the stock market crash, a
precipitous drop in advertising, questionable accounting, a slow
broadband transition, and reduced subscriber growth amid competition
from Microsoft and others.  These are serious problems, but they would
have emerged even without the merger.  Other highfliers from the
Internet boom, such as WorldCom and Webvan, are in bankruptcy.  Yet
Steve Case steps down as chairman of a corporation worth over $60
billion more than when he founded it.  Through skill or luck, he
cashed in his dotcom chips for real assets at the very peak of
irrational exuberance.

AOL has been written off before.  In 1996, facing the Internet tidal
wave, AOL opened its proprietary service to the Web and switched to
flat-rate pricing.  Analysts predicted it would be trounced.  Instead
it leveraged the Net for its own advantage, becoming an easy-to-use
gateway and an aggregation point for killer applications such as e-
commerce, chat and instant messaging.

The shift to a broadband Internet will be nearly as disruptive as the
Web was.  Once again, convergence proponents see control over content
and conduit as the path to success.  AOL Time Warner may not be the
company that proves them wrong.  But someone will.  And wherever he
is, Steve Case will be smiling.
