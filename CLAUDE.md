# CLAUDE.md — werbach.com

## Project Overview

**Repository:** `kwerbach/werbach.com`
**Status:** New / empty repository — no existing codebase, framework, or content yet.
**Purpose:** Personal website at `werbach.com`.

## Current State

This repository was freshly initialized and contains no source code, dependencies, or build configuration. All structure and tooling decisions are still to be made.

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow

- **Default branch:** To be established with the first push (use `main`).
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, `.env` files, or API keys.

### Code Quality

- Prefer simple, readable code over clever abstractions.
- Follow the conventions of whichever framework/tooling is adopted.
- Keep accessibility (a11y) in mind for all frontend work.
- Optimize images and assets before committing.

### File Organization (Recommended)

When building out the site, follow standard conventions for the chosen framework. At minimum, maintain separation between:

- **Source/content** — pages, posts, data files
- **Assets** — images, fonts, styles
- **Configuration** — build tools, deployment, environment
- **Templates/components** — reusable layout and UI pieces

### Deployment

No deployment pipeline is configured yet. When one is added, document it here.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This repo is currently empty. Do not assume any framework, build tool, or content structure exists unless files are present.
- Before making changes, always check what files and configuration actually exist.
- If tasked with building out the site, confirm the desired stack/framework with the user before generating scaffolding.
- Keep generated code minimal and production-oriented — avoid boilerplate bloat.
