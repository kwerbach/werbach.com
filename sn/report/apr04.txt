Connectivity and decentralization are the twin themes of Supernova.
These trends are unstoppable, and they are driving a wide range of
social, economic, and technology industry developments. Don't take my
word for it. Go check out MIT Business School professor Tom Malone's
new book, The Future of Work, just published to rave reviews.  His
thesis is that new technologies decentralize business organizations
and empower individuals -- ideas that shouldn't sound new to any
reader of this newsletter.

Just because decentralization has many advantages, though, doesn't
mean it's entirely beneficial. There are many downsides to more
distributed and more heavily networked forms of organization. Perhaps
the greatest of these is commoditization. If everyone is connected,
everyone has the opportunity to benefit from shared platforms and
shared knowledge... but it's difficult to sustain competitive
advantage.  Similarly, power diffusing out to individuals sounds great
if you're one of those individuals... but is considerably more scary
if you're an executive or government used to exercising centralized
control.

This issue of the Supernova Report covers two examples of the tensions
and conflicts that arise in a decentralizing world. The first involves
the revolution spurred by voice over IP at the edge of telecom
networks, challenging traditional business models. The US Federal
Communications Commission is struggling to address the challenges this
revolution poses. The second story involves intellectual property. We
don't even have a common language to express what's happening as
creative works are swept up into ubiquitous digital networks.

Challenges on the road to a decentralized future are among the key
high-level themes of this year's Supernova conference. We all love to
focus on the positive potential of new technologies. With the upcoming
Google IPO convincing many that "the Boom is Back," why examine the
hard questions? Because now is the worst time to ignore them. If the
tech and telecom recovery is going to have legs, we need to confront
honestly the obstacles in our path and the speed bumps on the road to
a better future. Of course, we can still do that in an upbeat,
enjoyable atmosphere!

Below your will find the draft agenda for Supernova 2004, now just two
months away. I encourage you to visit the conference website at
<http://www.supernova2004.com/> for more details, and to register
while there is still space available.

TELECOM
The FCC Muddies the VOIP Waters

The FCC decided last week to reject AT&T's voice over IP (VOIP)
petition.  AT&T argued that it shouldn't have to pay "access charges"
to local phone companies for VOIP traffic riding on its network
backbone.  The FCC disagreed.

The decision is troubling, for several reasons.  The Commission would
have been better off rolling these questions into its pending IP-
enabled services rulemaking proceeding.  That's where the serious
policy issues surrounding VOIP can be addressed in a forward-looking
way.  Instead, the FCC took a detour, apparently angered by AT&T's
unilateral action in withholding access charge payments.

This isn't just a defeat for AT&T.  It's a dangerous development.

The FCC's primary rationale was that the end-user service involved
still looks like traditional telephony. Yet it's hard to see how the
Commission can draw hard boundaries between services providing
"enhanced functionality" and those that don't.  VOIP adds new
flexibility among voice applications and services.  Starting down the
path of distinguishing "real" and "fake" VOIP, even if justified as a
policy matter, is going to put create all sorts of line-drawing
difficulties.

The FCC claimed it had to make this decision to provide certainty to
the industry, and to eliminate incentives for regulatory arbitrage.
Instead, it has created confusion and even more perverse incentives.
The FCC explicitly refused to decide whether AT&T is retroactively
liable for some $100 million in access charges it hasn't paid in the
past.  And it hung its decision on the fact that AT&T offers no
"enhanced functionality" to end users.  The first is simply an
abdication of responsibility; the second reflects an unwillingness to
acknowledge the flexible reality of voice as a data application.

These steps are bound to produce the last thing the telecom industry
needs right now: more litigation.  Instead of keeping the pressure on
for what's really essential -- broad-based reform of inter-carrier
compensation -- the FCC has ensured that companies will pour more
resources into court battles, which will ultimately kick the issues
back to the Commission.

I understand where the FCC was coming from.  They see AT&T trying to
game the system.  So they put their fingers in the dike to stop
further leakage from the access charge reservoir.  But the pressure
for a VOIP transition will only increase.  If it's just a matter of
time before the current system collapses, the FCC should put its
energy into figuring out the new system.  Rear-guard actions like this
one will only make the transition more painful.

9:30	PERSPECTIVE: Ray Ozzie (Groove Networks)

9:45	PANEL: THE NETWORK IS PEOPLE
While human beings are inherently social, the computer has
traditionally been a solitary beast. No more.  Yet ten years into the
commercial Internet era, with wireless connectivity and broadband
links sprouting up everywhere, we're just starting to grapple with the
new forms and practices of social software. Weblogs, social networking
tools, and cameraphones are manifestations of the new people-centric
digital ecology. How can the tools evolve to take into account the
subtleties of human social behavior?  And are there viable business
models for these early examples to grow into substantial market
segments?

10:30	BREAK

11:00	PANEL: SYNDICATION NATION
Syndication feeds allow users to aggregate and manipulate information
from dozens or hundreds of content sources.  They have become a staple
of the Weblog world and are increasingly conquering Web content. But
is there more to syndication than reading 300 blogs at once? The
growing number of entrepreneurs and investors working on syndication-
based tools seem to think so. Where is syndication going, and what are
the missing pieces for it to get there? Is syndication a shortcut to
the Semantic Web, the vision of adding rich structure to the mass of
information online?

FRIDAY, JUNE 25

7:30am	REGISTRATION AND CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST

8:30	INTRODUCTION BY KEVIN WERBACH - "Tyranny of the Commodity?"

8:45	PERSPECTIVE: Jonathan Schwartz (Sun Microsystems)

9:15	PANEL: EXPLODING THE ENTERPRISE
Business is increasingly distributed.  We work in shifting teams
separated by organization boundaries and geography, in organizations
increasingly dependent on independent contractors, telecommuters, and
outsourcers. How can technology help rather than hinder those
processes?  Will the grand visions of Web services and federated
digital identity become realities? Can any vendor make money in an
increasingly standards-based, commoditized marketplace? And what
happens to the people involved as centralized organizations are blown
apart?

10:00	BREAK

10:15	PERSPECTIVE: Niklas Zennstrom (Skype)

10:30	PANEL: VOICE AS A DATA APPLICATION
The trillion-dollar global telecommunications sector transforming into
something much more like the computer industry.  The shift from voice-
specific networks to voice applications running on top of broadband
data networks will upset industry economics, create huge new business
opportunities, and confound regulatory structures.  Below the
waterline, issues of addressing, standards, and interconnection will
play crucial and under-appreciated roles.  On the surface, new
applications will be even more significant than cheaper pricing for
plain old telephony.  But what are those applications?  What role will
carriers, technology vendors, equipment manufacturers, and end-users
play in defining them?  And will the new telecom industry be too
competitive and too innovative for its own (economic) good?

11:30	PANEL: DISRUPTIVE WIRELESS
Wireless connectivity will be the backbone of the emerging pervasive
Internet.  New technologies, unleashed by new approaches to spectrum
policy, promise an explosion of wireless communications capacity
unlike anything seen before.  Disruptive innovations in wireless range
from low-power ad hoc sensor nets to ultra-wideband video streaming
links to metropolitan-area data networks.  How real are these
scenarios, and what regulatory or other roadblocks stand in their way?
Are unlicensed technologies such as WiFi and WiMax a threat to the 3G
vision of wireless operators, or the mobile phone industry's true
future?  Will software radio and other innovations at the edges of
networks shift the balance of power in the wireless world?

12:30pm	LUNCH

2:00	PERSPECTIVE: Larry Lessig (Stanford Law School)

2:30	PANEL: TBA

3:30	BREAK

4:00	PANEL: BROADBAND LIFE: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER
There are now more than 25 million high-speed Internet subscribers in
the US.  Millions of customers in Asia enjoy broadband connections at
10 megabits or greater.  Yet the promise of the broadband home as a
networked hub for compelling media and computing experiences remains
elusive.  What are the killer applications, devices, standards, and
interfaces that will make broadband more than just a faster way to
surf the Web?  And once it arrives, how will the broadband home shift
industry dynamics and user behavior?

5:00	ROUNDTABLE: CLOSING THE BACK-CHANNEL LOOP
A group of experts will considered what we've learned over the past
two days, and what new questions have been formed.  We will surface
the interactive virtual communications channels that operate alongside
the physical conference, adding richness to the community.

6:00	CONFERENCE ENDS

MEDIA
Intellectual Property and the Evil Net

The problem with the current debate over digital content protection
isn't just the excessive restrictions certain industries want to
impose.  It's that we don't even have a common language to discuss
what's happening.  Case in point is a recent News.com story
<http://news.com.com/2100-1034_3-5193926.html?tag=nefd.lede> on
municipal broadband networks.  It featured the following quote from
Rocky Anderson, Mayor of Salt Lake City, explaining his opposition to
such networks:

	"I just don't see the social good in using taxpayer money to
	fund a network that provides more television and bandwidth for
	illegally downloading files," he said. "We should spend money
	on getting people fit, rather than deteriorating their quality
	of life with higher bandwidth to surf the Net."

This reminds me of the media coverage of the Internet around 1995.  A
good percentage of the stories in mainstream newspapers and magazines
focused on the dangers of online porn, privacy violations, and other
threats the Net posed to truth and decency.  Sure, those are real
issues.  But they were blown totally out of proportion.  The tenor of
the coverage suggested that the Net was a cesspool of filth, with
harms exceeding its benefits.

I thought we were beyond that point.  But now we seem to be back to a
similar discourse, with a twist.  The threat is that if you give
people better connectivity, they'll use it to -- gasp -- share files!
And no matter how many benefits broadband may provide, we can't afford
to let that happen.

Yes, downloading copyrighted music or movies that you don't have
rights to constitutes copyright infringement.  But so does making a
mix tape of a CD for your friends, or inviting a large group over to
watch a football game through your satellite hookup.  We don't
criticize government for building roads just because some people speed
and others drive to adult video stores.

The digital content discussion is increasingly polarized and
criminalized.  It's infecting the very language we use, which in turn
spurs further polarization.

Take, for example, the recent press release issues by the Department
of Justice <http://www.mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=65134>, announcing
the creation of an Intellectual Property Task Force.  It's full of
overheated rhetoric.  But the worse is the statement that
"Intellectual property industries play a significant role in the
American economy."

What exactly is an "intellectual property industry?" More to the
point, what isn't?  I doubt Wal-Mart would be very successful if
others could copy its name in misleading ways, or could reprint its
newspaper ads with higher prices.

Of course, that's not what the press release is talking about.  The
term is intended to redefine industries built around creative acts
(like the music business) as industries based on exclusive
formalizations of past creativity.  Larry Lessig and others have said
this better than I can, but the point remains important.  Countless
small rhetorical shifts have brought us to a point where the discourse
around intellectual property is wildly foreign to our professed
values.  Are our heros the pioneers who charted new territory... or
the land speculators who came later?

Yes, those who create digital goods are entitled to compensation, and
stealing the songs on a CD has a similar effect to stealing the
physical CD.  But the way this issue is being cast as a challenge to
our way of life is just excessive and counter-productive.

Digital distribution of media is the future.  There is simply no
alternative.  No amount of threatening language will scare people
enough to dissipate the profound business issues that transition
raises.  We should be having a debate about how to balance the various
interests of creators, distributors, and users of digital content.
Instead we're caught up in rhetoric that only obscured the real
issues.
