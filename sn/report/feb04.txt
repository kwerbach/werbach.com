And in a totally unrelated development, I welcomed mysecond child, Esther Ann Werbach, into the world on December 26.Esther has already expressed insightful views on the business modelsfor social networking software and WiFi hotspots.  I've booked her asa keynote speaker for Supernova 2035 -- early-bird registration isstill available!Seriously, there is nothing like having a baby to remind you how fastthe world is changing.  Esther will never know a world before theInternet, cell phones, Tivo, instant messaging, Weblogs, andbroadband.  Nor, I'm afraid, will she ever know the world that existedbefore September 11, 2001.Technology-driven change will not stop in the years to come.  Theimpacts of transformative phenomena like the Internet and pervasivewireless communication will only deepen.  I'm more excited than everto be working to understand the decentralizing technologies evolvingbefore our eyes.  Below, you'll find more information on this year'sSupernova conference, which is emerging as *the* networking event forthose building the distributed, networked digital future.  I hope youcan join us in June in Silicon Valley.-k-Kevin Werbach----------------------------------------------------------------------In this Issue:- INTERNET: Happy Anniversary- TELECOM: The Red Pill- TELECOM: Wagging the Internet dog- LINKS OF THE MONTH----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERNETHappy AnniversaryThe year 2004 marks two important anniversaries for the technologyworld. It was ten years ago that Netscape Navigator was released,marking the birth of the commercial World Wide Web.  And ten yearsbefore that, in 1984, AT&T was broken up.  These two developments,seemingly unrelated, came together to enable the Internet revolution.The AT&T divestiture started the US, and eventually much of the world,on a path from regulated monopoly communications providers towardscompetitive markets.  Ma Bell was The Network; after its divestiture,there was only a network of networks.  Telecommunications was suddenlyan emergent phenomenon, rising up from a shifting array of components.Interconnection, both between parallel physical networks and betweendifferent levels of software and hardware on those networks, becamefundamental.For more than a decade prior to 1984 and well after it, computerscientists were working on packet-switched data networks that operatedon the same internetworking principles.  With the birth of the Web anda simple tool to use it, the Internet became a mass phenomenon.  Itwas no longer just the domain of engineers and researchers.  Instead,he Net became as mainstream for businesses and consumers as thetelephone.The Web never would have happened without the AT&T divestiture, whichcreated an open network of communications networks to underlay thenascent open network of data networks and applications.  We have nowspent ten years working out the implications of those two epochalevents.  What comes next?It's too early to answer that question.  Twenty years is a reasonableperiod of time for a new technology to diffuse.  We're only halfwaythere for the Web.  We can certainly see some indicators of wherethings are going.  The coevolution of broadband connectivity, voiceover IP, and wireless technologies like WiFi will, in time, produce anew real-time communications platform as revolutionary as the Web.These are the piece-parts of the next telephone network, the enginethat will drive our connected society forward.At an investor conference I attended this week, there was a panel onvoice over IP.  The representative from Vonage, the brash VOIPstartup, predicted the end of the public switched telephone network in20 years.  The representative from Verizon, the old-line telco, didn'tdisagree.  In fact, he went further.  Verizon is no longer installingtraditional "Class 5" circuit switches into its network.  Startingthis year, it's installing IP-based "softswitches" instead.  The phonenetwork is going VOIP from the inside.I'm looking forward to surveying the landscape at the nextanniversary, in 2014.  But I'm really looking forward to watchingthings unfold in the interim.======================================================================----------------------------------------------------------------------S U P E R N O V A   2 0 0 4June 24-25, 2004Santa Clara, CAhttp://www.pulver.com/supernova/Supernova brings together cutting-edge entrepreneurs, technologists,executives, and thinkers to explore the decentralization of software,communications, and media.

The problemis that classification brings with it a whole set of baggage.  Atworst, law enforcement's approach would force the Internet into thecentralized, monopolized, regulated model of the old telephonenetwork.Law enforcement officials should certainly have the tools they need todo their jobs.  But in this case, they seem to believe that nothingelse matters.  We would have better security by requiring alltelephone calls to be tapped and all airline passengers to be chainedto their seats.  We don't do those things because the negativeconsequences far outweigh the security benefits.  The same test shouldapply here.Congress passed the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act(CALEA) in 1996 to address law enforcement concerns about wiretappingdata networks.  Law enforcement received further authority in 2001under the PATRIOT Act.  If voice over IP creates unanticipated newproblems for law enforcement, Congress should consider newlegislation.  Re-architecting the  Net isn't the way to get there.Now, this doesn't mean all aspects of legacy telecom regulation arebad.  The idea that monopoly transport networks should be openplatforms is entirely consistent with the basic architecture of theNet.  And it doesn't mean law enforcement should have no way to gainlegal access to VOIP conversations.  The point is that we shouldexamine the costs and benefits of every policy decision and use themost precise tools available.  Just as a blanket rule labelingeverything involving packet data as unregulated would go too far, sowould a blanket rule that all packet data be regulated to satisfy lawenforcement.This issue is important because it points out how central theseemingly arcane debates at the FCC are to the future of the Internetand communications.  this is where the rubber is meeting the pavement.We'll all be living with today's decisions for years to come.----------------------------------------------------------------------TELECOM'S RED PILL(Originally published January 2004 in VON Magazine)Ahh, 1999.  The year of monster technology IPOs, irrationalexuberance... and a Matrix movie that didn't suck.  Trust me, there'sa VOIP connection here.The Internet bubble was a dream world.  All destruction was seen ascreative.  Legions of dotcom entrepreneurs deluded themselves andtheir investors with PowerPoints extolling pageviews over profits.  Ina parallel development, the leaders of the telecom industry dreamed ofconvergence as a positive-sum game for all industry players.  Newrevenues from data-oriented services would supercharge once staidincumbents, while technologies such as VOIP made underlying networksmore cost-efficient.  A riding tide of bits would float all boats.Welcome to the real world.  For the past three years, telecom andtechnology companies have struggled against a tide of both rationaland irrational depression.  VOIP, written off by many as nothing morethan hype, suffered as much as any sector through the downturn.  Asthe market turns around and enthusiasm returns to the VOIP world, wemust be careful not to delude ourselves again.  Deployment isoccurring, investment is coming back, and innovation is quickeningagain.  Such developments do not, however, mean the path forward willbe smooth.There are only two intellectually honest viewpoints about the futureof the telecom industry.  One is doom-and-gloom.  The other is doom-and-hope.  As Morpheus offered in The Matrix, we can take the bluepill and hope to live pleasantly in a dream, or we can take the redpill and charge headlong into the ugly truth.The blue pill vision says that telecom is locked in a deflationarydeath spiral.  Overcapacity remains a deadly threat, accentuated bynewly energized post-bankruptcy poster children such as MCI.  VOIPcould be a contributing factor in undermining the subsidy mechanismsthat pervade traditional telecom services.  It will also make itdifficult for incumbents to operate at a profitable level, as theyface competition from a more efficient technology.  Fixed costs ofnetwork construction and operation will remain high, while thecombination of competition and technological innovation pushes pricesbelow the level necessary to recover those investments.The most thoughtful advocate of this viewpoint is Eli Noam of ColumbiaBusiness School, a distinguished telecommunications scholar.  Hebelieves that only the stabilizing influence of regulators andoligopolies can avert a crisis.  In other words, the solution is topull back from the brink, put the competitive genie back in thebottle, and try to return to the stable telecom world of the 1970s.VOIP, in this view, must be sacrificed to the regulatory gods topreserve entrenched subsidies.The red pill is the alternative argument.  It says that the death ofthe telecom industry as we know it is inevitable.  Efforts to pull itout of the tailspin will only prolong and increase the pain.  Tenyears ago, there was a $200 billion annual service business in the USbased primarily on charging usage fees for voice communications.  Thatis going away.  Something else may replace it, but it will be a datainternetworking industry with voice as one application.  In aggregate,it may generate $200 billion in sales, but the direct comparable tothe pre-existing voice industry will be closer to $50 billion, or evenless.   There is no way to make up in volume the massive compressionthat VOIP represents for the price of voice communication.Choose the red pill, and there is no turning back.  It's much easierto dismiss today's dinosaurs than it is to replace them successfully.Hard questions about reliability, security, and interoperability willbecome even harder as VOIP becomes not just an adjunct but asubstitute for the grand edifice circuit-switched telephony.  Thenumbers actually have to add up -- for customers, vendors, serviceproviders, and investors.  As VOIP advocates, we can no longer claimpreferential treatment as a "nascent industry" if we are going afterthe crown jewels of telephony.  We need to roll up our sleeves andfight the battles at the national level over regulation, and at theinternational level over addressing mechanisms such as ENUM.  We needto decide who our friends are, as titans such as Microsoft and Comcastbecome major players in this world.The all-IP communications future has no exact precedent, which shouldmake us humble.  The closest comparison is the computers industry,which should make us humbler still.  That business has made manyfortunes, but also produced more than its share of failures.  No onecan be sure ahead of time that they will be Dell or Microsoft, and notone of their less-fortunate competitors.  If voice is truly just acommodity, the winners may be those who best understand branding oroperational efficiency, rather than those who pioneer technology.  Andif voice is still unique and valuable above and beyond its objectivebandwidth and quality-of-service requirements, there's no escaping thepublic policy questions.We have a choice of two worlds:  one in which the Internet remains asubset of telecommunications, and one in which telecommunications is asubset of the Internet.  Let's see how far this rabbit hole goes.----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERESTING LINKShttp://www.diepunyhumans.com/archives/006847.htmlCory Doctorow sums up the last 20 yearshttp://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-243556A1.pdfFCC Chairman Powell advocates four "Internet freedoms"http://www.tacd.org/docs/?id=225Revealing study on user perceptions of spamhttp://www.wirelessfuture.org/Wireless Future Conference in March (I'm speaking)http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/68/35307.htmlHalf a billion mobile phones sold in 2003----------------------------------------------------------------------If you are aware of others who would like to receive the SupernovaReport, please forward this email and copy supernova@pulver.com.
