Ihope to see you in Washington!-k-Kevin Werbach----------------------------------------------------------------------In this Issue:- SOFTWARE: Let's Get Together- MEDIA: Silly Conference Reporting Restrictions- LINKS OF THE MONTH----------------------------------------------------------------------SOFTWARELet's Get Together: The big story of 2003-2004What do you get when you combine a soft economy with a deregulatoryideology and a technological discontinuity?  One word: consolidation.In recent weeks, Palm bought Handspring, PeopleSoft announced plans toacquire JD Edwards, and Oracle announced a stunning hostile takeoverbid for PeopleSoft.  That's nothing.  Get ready for more big mergerannouncements in the months to come.Consolidation will happen for several reasons. The first is simpleeconomics: there's only so many dollars to go around.  Everyone inhigh-tech was hoping that the economic downturn would be over by now,but we're still bumping along the bottom of the IT spending trough.The IPO and venture financing windows have cracked open, but nowherenear wide  enough to save hundreds of startups living on borrowedtime.  The telecom sector continues to wallow through an out-and-outdepression, not helped by the failure of broadband and 3G wireless tomeet unrealistic expectations.  Innovation and opportunity stillexist.  Nonetheless, the market as a whole still has too muchcapacity.The US government is throwing gasoline on the fire.  The FCC'sdecision to loosen media ownership rules is a green light for furtherconsolidation in those industries.  Its new so-called localcompetition rules will push more new entrants out of business and givecommunications monopolies more reason to choose mergers over realcompetition.The third reason for the coming wave of consolidation is less obviousto the casual observer.  Yet it's probably the most significant.  Thetechnological pressure toward decentralization of communications,software, and media is turning sources of competitive advantage intocommodities.  Instead of big, proprietary, centralized systems withtheir lucrative annuity revenue streams, vendors are findingthemselves forced to sell smaller, standards-based components.Service providers are finding themselves competing against theradically different economics of edge-based systems, or even their owncustomers.Just as softswitches and SIP servers are replacing switches in telecomnetworks at a fraction of the cost, applications built using Webservices and open-source platforms such as Linux are shrinking theonce-booming market for enterprise software.  Companies are deployingWeblog tools and hosted offerings such as Salesforce.com, instead ofwriting six-figure checks for content management and customerrelationship management.More of the action is happening in the outer rings of networks -- theIntel-based servers, the wireless handsets, and the end-user PCs.Whether this trend is good or bad depends on your perspective.  Itgives users a better deal and more control.  But it further shrinksthe available pie for providers of software and infrastructure.  Theend result: Everyone must either find a small but lucrative niche, orget big enough to compete with gorillas like Microsoft, IBM, Cisco,Nokia, and Sony.We've seen this before.  In the PC business, just about the only onesmaking money are Dell (the biggest and most efficient player), and thesmall vendors such as Alienware specializing in gaming machines.  IBM,HP/Compaq, Gateway, and Sony are either bleeding or building PCs forstrategic reasons beyond profitability in that market.The Oracle bid for PeopleSoft is perfect example of what to expect.Oracle is prepared to spend $6 billion effectively to shut down acompany with 8,000 employees and thousands of blue-chip customers.  Itdoesn't matter if this is just Larry Ellison "behaving badly."Whether or not the deal goes through, the fact that it's being takenseriously shows there's a method to Larry's madness.  There is excesscapacity in the market, and consolidation is the way to squeeze itout.  The alternative, which we're seeing in the cases of Lucent,3Com, Nortel, and possibly Sun, is slow death.Let me be clear:  I'm not too happy about the consolidation wave I seecoming.  When companies spend their energy buying each other, theytend to put less effort into building better products.  Major mediacompanies may squeeze out some inefficiencies by aggregating moretelevision stations or combining different properties that werepreviously off-limits, but that won't do anything to address the majorchallenges of digitization, pervasive connectivity, and user controlthey face.Too bad.  Markets do what they want to do, and in cases like this,most efforts to stop them won't make things any better.  Just as thehundreds of US car companies early in the 20th century have dwindledto three, IT sectors will lose diversity as they mature.  Is WallStreet better thanks to the rampant consolidation among brokeragehouses?  Is the accounting industry more effective now that the BigSeven are the Big Four?  It hardly matters.Of course, smart businesspeople will continue to seize on newopportunities almost as fast as competitors in the old categories dieoff.  That's what happens as industries mature.  The opportunities forvalue creation shift, but the overall ecology can remain healthy anddiverse.The companies that succeed in the coming period of consolidation won'tnecessary be the ones that do the most buying.  Cisco, which acquiredmore companies than anyone during the Internet boom, has dramaticallyslowed its acquisition binge.  It's sitting on billions in cash andcan purchase assets and talent for a tiny fraction of 1999 rates.  Butit hasn't allowed itself to get caught up in dealmaking for its ownsake.  When you hold all the good cards, standing pat may be the beststrategy.  On the other side of the equation, sometimes no amount ofscale is enough.  Whether local phone companies survive widespreadintroduction of voice-over-IP and substitution by wireless serviceshas little to do with how big or efficient they become.Consolidation feeds on itself.  As soon as one company is "in play,"it forces everyone else in the sector to take a good hard look atthemselves.  Get ready for a game of musical chairs that's not likelyto end until the economy really starts growing again.----------------------------------------------------------------------SUPERNOVA 2003July 8-9, Washington, DC area<http://www.pulver.com/supernova/>Supernova brings together cutting-edge executives and companies toconsider the distributed future of communications, software, andmedia.

At the Wall StreetJournal's recent "D" conference, armchair Webloggers broke news simplybecause the professional journalists sitting next to them weren'tallowed to report.For a small private workshop, fine. But any time a CEO of a publiccompany stands up in front of several hundred executives, he or sheknows what they say is fair game. After all, journalists could justinterview the attendees and get them to confirm what the speaker said.The ostensible reason for these restrictions is that speakers feelmore comfortable knowing they are in a "private" setting.  But why arethose speakers  standing on stage at conferences if not to get publicexposure?  Any executive worth his or her salt knows what youshouldn't say at a public gathering, regardless of whether those inthe room are officially labeled as journalists.  Heck, dozens ofexecutives and Wall Street analysts are facing prosecution for thingsthey put in personal email messages!At Supernova, we put no such restrictions on attendees. A conferenceis a conversation, and if you're not comfortable saying something thatmight be repeated, don't say it. Pervasive Internet connectivity andlow barriers to publishing are realities that everyone needs to dealwith. From my perspective, the fact that attendees, whetherprofessional journalists or not, can blog the event is a benefit, nota threat. It enhances the conference for those present and thoseelsewhere.----------------------------------------------------------------------INTERESTING LINKS FROM MAY/JUNE 2003http://tinyurl.com/ejmdBush Administration launches year-long spectrum review.http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.htmlPetition sponsored by Prof. Lawrence Lessig promoting the "EldredAct," which would reform copyright law to expand the public domain.http://www.economist.com/finance/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=1812344The Economist (sort of) endorses open spectrum.http://tinyurl.com/ejne"Does IT Matter?," a provocative piece by Nicholas Carr in the HarvardBusiness Review.
