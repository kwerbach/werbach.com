Registration is free and the course begins on August 27, 2012.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <h3>1]  What is Gamification? </h3>

<p><em>After the introductory material on the course, the first topic we need to cover is what gamification actually means.  As we’ll see, there isn’t universal agreement.  However, there are a set of concepts and examples that are clearly within the scope of gamification.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>1.1 Introduction
<li>1.2 Course overview and logistics
<li>1.3 Gamification defined
<li>1.4 Why study gamification? 
<li>1.5 History of gamification 
<li>1.6 Categories and examples</ul>


<h3>2]  Games</h3>

<p><em>You can't understand gamification without understanding games. This unit explains why the concept of games is deeper than most people realize, and the game-based foundations for gamification.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;"><li>2.1 Gamification in context
<li>2.2 What is a game? 
<li>2.3 Games and Play
<li>2.4 Video games 
<li>2.5 It’s Just a Game?</ul>

<h4>WEEK 1 HOMEWORK: Quiz</h4>

<h3>3]  Game Thinking</h3>

<p><em>The ways game designers approach their craft is also the way to tackle a gamification project. Seeing situations through the lens of game design is an essential skill in this area.</em></p>


<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>3.1 Why Gamify
<li>3.2 Thinking Like a Game Designer 
<li>3.3 Design rules
<li>3.4 Tapping the Emotions
<li>3.5 Anatomy of Fun
<li>3.6 Finding the Fun</ul>

<h3>4]  Game Elements</h3>

<p><em>The raw materials of games and gamification are called game elements.  We'll earn how to break down a game into its constituent parts and apply them to create gamified systems.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>4.1 Breaking Games Down 
<li>4.2 The pyramid of elements
<li>4.3 The PBL Triad
<li>4.4 Limitation of Elements
<li>4.5 Bing Gordon interview</ul>

<h4>WEEK 2 HOMEWORK: Quiz</h4>

<h3>5]  Psychology and Motivation (I)</h3>

<p><em>Gamification is a technique for motivation, so it ties very directly into psychology. This unit introduces the behavioral psychology concepts relevant to gamification.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>5.1 Gamification as motivational design
<li>5.2 Behaviorism
<li>5.3 Behaviorism in gamification
<li>5.4 Reward structures

<h3>6]  Psychology and Motivation (II)</h3>

<p><em>The previous unit explains the benefits of a behavioral approach to gamification; this one identifies the risks and alternatives.</em></p>

<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>6.1 Limits of behaviorism
<li>6.2 Dangers of behaviorism

<li>7.4 D4: Activity loops
<li>7.5 D5/6: Don’t forget the fun and deploy</ul>

<h3>8]  Design Choices</h3>

<p><em>Saying that gamification is a form of design means that it should involve a creative, human-centered, thoughtful process to achieve the best results. This unit identifies important considerations and options.</em></p>
