There will be a major plane crash.  I'm predicting it right now.  Not because I have some great psychic power to see the future, or because of an anonymous tip from my good friends in the world of international terrorism, but for the same reason I know there will be a major earthquake.
<p>
I don't know when, I don't know where, but I am sure of will.  The reason I am sure is that the technology of airplans is sufficiently complex that absolute safety is an impossibility.  I am not talking about chance or luck, I am talking about complexity.  No matter how carefully the designers consider and plan for every eventuality, they will not -- cannot -- anticipate everything that can go wrong.  this is because, ultimately, complexity is geometric rather than arithmetic.  Each addiitonal element not only adds its own new layer of complexity, it interacts with every layer already present.  These feedback loops mean that small changes can have big effects, because their alterations to the system depend on every other element.
<p>
The Earth is the same way, only infinitely more complex.
<p>
A perhaps not so obvious implication of this complexity is that we live in a quantum universe.  A quantum universe is one that is fundamentally probabalistic.  What physicists discovered in the early part of this century is that, at the microscopic level of the building blocks of matter, there is no certainty, only probability.  An electron does not exist in a given place at a given time, only a cloud of probabilities that describes where the electron is likely to be.  This is, rephrased, the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Another way to put it is that the very process of measuring the electron alters its location, so there is no objective way to determine where the electron is [add wavelength of light issue]
<p>
Another formulation of the anthropic principle is this.  The universe we live in must be quantum, because it is of sufficient complexity to form matter.
<p>
Probability is all around us, although we do not always see it that way.  Eating fatty foods does not increase the likelihood you will have a heart attack, only the probability. [more]
<p>
This is dicomforting.  We want certainty, and we look to religion for that reason.  Probability is unsatisfying for the individual, even if you can take comfort in the knowledge of what is most likely to occur.
