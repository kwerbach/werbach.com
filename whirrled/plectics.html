The ethic of whirrled is captured perfectly by the science that Nobel
Laureate Murry Gell-Mann has termed "plectics" -- the study of the simple
and the complex.  Plectics encompasses disciplines such as chaos theory
and complexity, but also emphasizes the quest for simplicity amid seeming
randomness.  

Doyne Farmer, one of the leading developers of chaos theory, makes the
point explicitly.  There are two sides of the branch of mathmatics known as
chaos theory.  One side, the "Jurassic Park" branch, is about finding
daunting complexity in things that we think are easily understood and
controlled.  Complexity theory demonstrates that for sufficiently complex
systems, such as an ecosystem or the New York Stock Exchange, tiny
variations in inputs can result in vastly different outputs.  No matter how
well you understand the original conditions of a system, you cannot reliably
predict where the system will go in the future, because its development is
contingent on so many inter-related variables and feedback loops.  

The flip side of complexity theory, however, is that in seeming randomness
there may be pockets of order.  Fractal geometry allows extremely realistic
scenes of nature to be drawn from stunningly simple mathmatical formulas. 
Even more significantly, order will inevitably emerge from a system that is
sufficiently complex.  This order arises not from any conscious design, but
from the emergent properties of independent and interdependent elements.
 Biologist Stuart Kauffman calls this "order for free."  He makes the
argument that "complex adaptive systems" self-organize not as the result of
pure chance, but as the result of inherent properties of complexity.  

So what does all this have to do with whirrled?

A great deal.
