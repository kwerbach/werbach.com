<img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>World War
I.  World War II.  Viet Nam.  These three conflicts
have been seminal events for every twentieth-century American
generation before our own.  The significance of these wars goes beyond
the lives lost, and the national consensus or national divisiveness
they engendered.  Each war, in its own way, resulted a crushing
betrayal of expectations.  

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>   World
War I, the &quot;Great War,&quot; brought to a shocking conclusion
the Victorian Era and the 19th century ideal of eternal progress. 
Barbed wire and poison gas crushed the idea of an ever-progressing
civilization.  

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>World
War II brought us Hiroshima.  On the day the first atomic
bomb was dropped, the world changed irrevocably.  Every person alive
must now accept the fact that we have the capability to exterminate all
of humanity.  

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>Vietnam
shattered the confidence of Americans that their nation
was invincible. 

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>Those
born in the 1970s and after have had no such
disappointments.  We still believe that technology will make us free,
for we have never truly seen the enormity of destruction that
technology can bring.  On the contrary, the Persian Gulf War showed us
images of warfare as video game, stripping the encounters of their
terror and destructiveness.  With the end of the compulsory draft in
the early 1970s, the threat of being exposed directly to war receded
even farther from the consciousness of the new generation.  It is true
that, thanks to the communications revolution, warfare around the world
is brought to our doorstep instantaneously.  We know exactly what is
happening in the streets of Somalia, Bosnia, and Kuwait City as it is
occurring.  At the same time, the images are distant, otherworldly. 
These conflicts are not about us.  They will have no effect on our
daily lives.

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>Clearly,
we do not live in a world without war.  More people
have died in armed conflicts since the end of World War II than
perished during that struggle.  But we do live in a
world where war is no longer a reference point.  We do not draw a
straight line from technological innovation to napalm-engulfed babies
or disintegrated cities.  We are enthralled by the potential of
technology, captivated by its aura, unwilling to imagine the
apocalyptic potential of what humanity has created.  So we dive in,
headfirst.  We give ourselves up to technology, whether it be credit
cards or home video games.  

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>But the
implications of the absence of war go deeper.  There are
two sides to war as it has affected American society.  In addition to
the destruction of expectations, war has also had the effect of
crystalizing who we are.  War causes people to focus on their identity,
and to distinguish themselves from the &quot;other.&quot;  The two World Wars
united Americans against external enemies, while Viet Nam created two
opposing groups within American society.  For the younger generation of
the 1960s, the one that opposed the Viet Nam war, the conflict provided
a focal point for generating an identity.  

<p><img align=left src="../images/dot_clear.gif" width=20 height=1>The new
generation, the children of those Baby Boomers that
fought the Viet Nam war, has neither suffered the crushing of idealism
nor experienced that exuberance of identity that result from war.  We
believe that the future should be bright, but we have lost the
connections that color our view of what we want the future to bring us. 
Alone in a world of opportunity, we seek consolation in our
technological toys, but the solace they give us is ultimately
unsatisfying.

will be our substitute for war?</B>
