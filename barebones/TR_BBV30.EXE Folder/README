Hi,
You will find the Turkish translation of the Bare Bone Guide to HTML.

1-) As in V2.0 I add the Turkish character chart to the HTML document.

2-)I made the TEXT file translation but people  may have some difficulties
to look at just by typing it from the DOS prompt. So I included a file
named DOS2WIN.EXE which converts DOS based Turkish character to WINDOWS based
Turkish charecters.

3-)Would you please add a simple line to your page
to warn people who want to retrieve the plain text version. If they can not
get any results from TR_BBV30.TXT they need to convers the document by using
DOS2WIN.EXE and try any word processor to display. (Lets hope that this
will work for every body ...)

4-)There is a mising anchor in you original document. On BACKGROUNDS AN COLOR
division you are pointing to /barebone_annotation#color . But there is no
anchor named color within the annotaion file ..would you please check it?

5-)this is the list of the files and their size
